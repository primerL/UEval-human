    "reference_text": "1. 1. Begin by drawing an oval. This will help you to sketch the first glove. 2. 2. Use a curved line to enclose a rounded rectangular shape on top of the oval. This forms the wrist of the glove. 3. 3. Erase the oval from the wrist. Then, enclose a rectangle across the wrist. 4. 4. Erase one side of the oval. Use overlapping curved lines to form the glove's thumb and mitten. Use short curved lines to draw a starburst pattern at the point where the two lines meet. 5. 5. Draw a second oval overlapping the first glove. Erase as necessary. 6. 6. Erase the top of the oval and sketch in a rectangular shape with rounded corners. It should overlap the first glove, so erase as necessary. This forms the wrist of the glove. Then, enclose another rectangular shape within the first. Draw curved lines across the base of the glove to indicate the curvature of the material. 7. 7. Erase the side of the oval. Outline the thumb and mitten of the glove using two overlapping curved lines. Use shorter curved lines to draw a starburst pattern at the point where the two lines meet. Then, draw a curved line from the wrist to this junction, indicating a seam. 8. 8. Draw a circle above the gloves. This will form the hook from which the gloves hang. Draw a \"U\" shaped line above it. Below it, extend two curved lines and double them back upon themselves. Then, draw pairs of lines from the hook to each glove. This represents the string used to hang the gloves. 9. 9. Detail the glove. Draw curved lines across the wrist and side of the glove to indicate wrinkles and seams. 10. Color your boxing gloves. They are typically red.",

    "generated_text": "Here are the **text steps** (separate from the visual):\n\n1. Shapes & pose\n   Lightly sketch two tall ovals for the glove bodies, tilted slightly toward each other. Add a short horizontal line beneath each for the wrist opening.\n\n2. Cuffs\n   Turn each wrist line into a short “cuff cylinder”: draw a thin rectangle wrapping the base of each oval.\n\n3. Knuckle dome\n   Round the top of each oval into a smooth dome. Add a soft, shallow curve near the top front to suggest the knuckle ridge.\n\n4. Thumbs\n   On the inner side of each glove, attach a teardrop/bean shape for the thumb pad. Its tip points toward the knuckle ridge; its base connects near the cuff.\n\n5. Palm panel\n   Inside each glove, sketch a curved panel that starts under the thumb, swoops across the palm, and meets the cuff—this is the padded palm section.\n\n6. Clean silhouette\n   Trace a single confident outline around each glove (dome → front knuckle → thumb → palm → cuff). Erase construction lines.\n\n7. Details & seams\n   Add short dashed or stitched lines along the knuckle ridge, around the thumb base, and near the cuff edge. If you prefer laces, sketch a narrow opening on the front of one glove with an “X-X-X” lace pattern; otherwise add a simple strap rectangle.\n\n8. Overlap & depth\n   Decide which glove sits slightly forward. Thicken that glove’s outer contour a bit more and let it overlap the other to create depth.\n\n9. Shading\n   Pick a light source (e.g., top-left). Lightly shade the underside of the knuckle dome, the inner thumb curve, and the gap between gloves. Darken the cuff underside. Keep the top planes lighter.\n\n10. Highlights\n    Leave slim unshaded arcs along the upper knuckle and thumb to suggest glossy padding.\n\n11. Final linework\n    Go over the main contour with a steady, slightly thicker line; keep stitching and fold lines thinner so they read as surface detail.\n\n12. Color (optional)\n    Fill the gloves with a base color (classic red works well). Add a darker tone along the shaded edges and a lighter tint on top planes. Keep cuffs a touch darker than the glove body.\n\nWant the steps as a printable handout or in a different style (cartoon, realistic, vintage)? I can format that too.\n",

    "reference_text": "1. 1. Begin by drawing a curved line. This will form one side of the rocket ship. 2. 2. Draw another curved line mirroring the first. They should meet in a gentle curve on the top end, but they should not connect on the bottom end. This outlines the body, or fuselage, of the rocket. 3. 3. Enclose the open end of the rocket using a pair of straight lines. 4. 4. Band the nose cone with two pairs of curved parallel lines. 5. 5. Draw portholes, or small windows, along the side of the rocket. To do so, draw several circles of different sizes. 6. 6. Draw the rocket's fin. First, draw a straight line from the tail of the rocket to its middle. Then, draw curved lines downward from each end of the straight line. Allow the curved lines to meet at a gentle point. 7. 7. Erase guide lines from the fin. 8. 8. Draw the rocket's second fin. To do so, extend two curved lines from the top side of the rocket - one emerging from the middle of the ship, the other from its base. Allow the lines to meet at a gentle point. 9. 9. Draw the flames, called exhaust, coming from the rocket's nozzle, or base. Use a series of short curved lines that meet in jagged points to draw a rounded triangular shape. Then, use another series of lines to draw a second layer. Finally, draw the third layer of the exhaust, allowing it to end at a point. 10. Color your rocket. Rockets such as the one in this drawing guide were popular illustrations during the 1950s and 1960s. Some were silver in color, while others had bright red, blue, or other colored markings.",

Add a smaller inner circle for glass depth (or a ring around it).\n\n5. Panel bands\n   Add one or two horizontal bands across the lower body for seams. Keep them slightly curved to match the rocket’s form.\n\n6. Clean outline\n   Trace your best lines with a darker stroke. Erase the centerline and any construction marks.\n\n7. Fire & smoke\n   From the nozzle, draw layered flame shapes (long inner teardrop, wider outer). Add puffy smoke clouds below if you like.\n\n8. Details & color\n   Optional bolts (small dots along seams), little stars around it. Color idea: red fins/nose, gray/white body, blue window, yellow-orange flames.\n\n**Proportions & tips**\n\n* Body height ≈ 5 body-widths; fins start around the lower third.\n* Mirror the fins by measuring their base and top points from the centerline.\n* Keep line weight consistent; save thicker lines for the outer silhouette.\n\nIf you want a printable worksheet or different styles (cute/chibi, realistic, isometric), tell me the vibe and I’ll make another visual.\n",

    "reference_text": "1. Preheat your oven to 375ºF (190ºC). 2. Grease and line a 9×9 in. (23 x 23 cm.) baking tray about an inch deep. You can also line the pan with aluminum foil, if you like. If you don't have anything to line the tray with, grease the tray with butter and add a light layer of flour over. 3. Melt the butter or margarine in a small pan over low heat. While this is melting, complete the next two steps. It should take about a minute or two for the butter to melt. It'll melt faster if you start off with it at room temperature. 4. Mix the caster sugar and eggs in a separate bowl. Pour the sugar and eggs into a medium-sized bowl and stir the ingredients together until they're fully incorporated. This should take about a minute. You can use a wooden spoon, a whisk, or even an electric mixer to stir the ingredients together. 5. Mix the flour and chocolate powder together in a separate bowl. Now, pour these ingredients into a separate bowl and stir them until they are fully incorporated. 6. Pour the melted butter into the sugar and egg mixture. Then, stir until the butter is well mixed in. This will make a nice, light yellow, creamy mixture. 7. Sift in the cocoa mixture into the egg mixture a little at a time. Just pour the ingredients into a sieve and gently shake it to let the air in while the cocoa mixture falls down into the egg mixture. You can even lightly scrape a fork along the bottom of the sieve to help sift the cocoa mixture. 8. Add the chocolate chips into the mixture. Now, you can mix in the chocolate chips into the rest of the ingredients. You can use regular chocolate chips, or cute mini chips if you prefer that. If you're feeling adventurous and want to mix things up, you can also go for the white chocolate chips. [ citation needed ] 9. Pour the mixture into the baking tray. Now that the tray is greased, it should be all ready for you to pour in the mixture. Use a flat plastic mixer or knife to even out the mixture. It doesn't have to be perfectly even, but try to distribute it around the pan as evenly as you can so that the brownies are of even height throughout. [ citation needed ] 10. Insert the tray on the middle shelf of the oven and bake for 30 minutes. After 25 minutes, keep checking on the brownies to make sure they don't burn. You can even clean up while you're waiting for your brownies to cook. If you hang around the kitchen while the brownies begin to harden, you'll be craving this sweet treat even more! 11. Remove the brownies from the oven and let them cool. Wait at least five minutes for the brownies to cool. This will also give them time to harden a bit. If you cut into them when they're still cooling, it'll be harder to cut them cleanly. 12. Cut the brownies into bite-size chunks. You can cut tiny pieces, so you can devour them in one bite each. You can also cut larger brownies, so each portion is nice and hearty. It's up to you -- if you're making them for a large event, then the smaller, the better. But if you're just cooking for yourself and a few friends or family members, why not cut them to be a little bigger? You can even top them with confectioner's sugar for an extra sweet taste.",

If you have to drive slowly for a block or two to get to a safe, flat area, then so be it.Examples of safe areas are as follows: The shoulder of the highway, a public parking lot, or a large space with no pedestrian activity. Apply the parking brake once you’re parked to ensure the vehicle doesn’t move. For added peace of mind, place heavy rocks or blocks around each tire you aren’t changing to keep the vehicle from rolling. 2. The spare will likely be underneath a cover in the trunk. Every make and model will be a little bit different, but your spare should be under the cloth or plastic cover at the bottom of your trunk. Retrieve the wheel from the trunk. Also, remove the jack and the tire iron you need to remove the lug nuts. The tools for completing the change - including the jack, and lug wrench - will be located near the spare tire. On most vehicles, the tire iron is part of the jack. You’ll use it to turn the bolt on the end of the jack to raise or lower it, and also to remove the lug nuts on the tire. If you drive a Jeep or a large SUV, the spare tire may be on the outside or underneath the vehicle. If you don’t have a spare, your vehicle may have a sealant kit to temporarily patch your flat tire . If you don’t have that either, call a tow truck. 3. Move around your vehicle and check for any damaged components or wheels. This article focuses on replacing damaged tires - be sure to contact roadside services in the event you are experiencing any issues you cannot safely handle yourself either due to lack of experience, tools, replacement parts, or severity of the damage. 4. Provided you have the tools necessary, find a solid point on the frame of your vehicle to elevate the portion of the car near the wheel you need to replace. Remember to place the jack in a position that won't be hit by yourself or others, risking the vehicle being dropped from the jack. Elevate the vehicle until the tire is no longer touching the ground (recommended 1-2 inches) Place the jack on a part of the frame that will not damage or warp components of your vehicle, causing more damage. Begin to lift the vehicle by pressing down on the floor jack or by turning the floor jack handle slowly. You will begin to see the tires lift from the ground. To have enough room to dismount the tire, you want to make sure that the tire is at least lifted 3-6 inches from off the ground. Grab your jack stands. These are used as a safety precaution so that the vehicle doesn't fall to the ground in case your floor jacks break or slip. The owner's manual will show you where to place them. To engage the jack stands, use the lever that is attached to them and line it up with the jack stand point (Usually indicated by an arrow engraved into the car) but only raise the stand to about an inch or two away from the jack stand point which is usually the frame of the car. CAREFULLY release the pressure from your floor jack so that the vehicle falls into place with the jack stands 5. Remove the hubcap and loosen the nuts part-way. Start with the lowest bolt and avoid causing damage to the undamaged bolts/lug nuts. Pry the hubcap off using the flat end of your tire iron or a flathead screwdriver. Do not remove the lug nuts entirely. Just use the end of the tire iron to loosen the nuts by turning them counterclockwise so that there’s no longer any resistance. You should be able to spin the nuts by hand, but they shouldn’t be so loose that they spin freely. By keeping the wheel on the ground when you first loosen the nuts, you'll make sure that you're turning the nuts instead of the wheel. Your tire iron may have different sizes of openings on each end. The correct end for the nut will slip easily onto it, but it won’t be so loose that it rattles. If your vehicle doesn’t have a hub cap, don’t worry about that part. If it does, your hub cap may have a center cap that needs to be unscrewed first. On some newer vehicles you need a special “key” to unlock one of the lug nuts as a theft prevention strategy. Look in your glove box and trunk for a special tool that’ll remove that unique lug nut. These lug nuts will have a unique groove inside of them. Use the key to remove the locking lug nut. Keep all bolts as you will be using them to connect your spare tire to your car. 6. Place the divot in the jack directly under the metal rim of the frame. Get on the ground and use the flashlight on your phone to take a closer look. Touch the area directly behind the metal body of your exterior to feel and look for a thin, metal length. This is your frame. Set the jack underneath the frame right next to the tire you’re replacing. Many cars have molded plastic along the bottom. If you don't place the jack in the right spot, it will crack the plastic when you start lifting. If you're not sure about the right place to put the jack, read your owner's manual. There may be a small notch or mark just behind the front wheel wells, or in front of the rear wheel wells where the jack is intended to be placed. 7. Use the jack to raise your tire 4–6 inches (10–15 cm) off of the ground. Turn the handle of the jack clockwise to begin raising the platform up. Once the platform on the jack makes contact with the vehicle, take a look at the point where the jack meets the frame to confirm it’s on your frame. If it isn’t, loosen the jack and reposition it. If it is, continue to lift your vehicle off the ground . The vast majority of jacks are scissor jacks. You use the tire iron or a rod to twist the nut on the side and hoist the vehicle. You might have a pump-assisted jack, though. With a pump jack, you repeatedly move the handle up and down to raise the vehicle hydraulically. This can be kind of freaky the first time you do it. You might think your jack is going to snap or your car is going to tilt over. Don’t worry! Your jack and vehicle are designed to handle this. It can take a few minutes and a lot of elbow grease to get that vehicle up, so feel free to take breaks if you need to. It’s worth double-checking to make sure the jack is on the frame. You really don’t want to damage your vehicle with the jack. Make sure the vehicle is secure in the air by pressing down on the side of the vehicle that is jacked up in the air. Next, you need to add some wheel chalks to the opposite side wheels of the vehicle. If you have the car jacked from the front left side of the vehicle, then you would want to place two wheel-chocks under the rear tires to prevent the vehicle from rolling. 8. Pop the nuts off by hand and pull the tire off. You already loosened the nuts, so removing them should be fairly easy. Use the tire iron and brace the tire with your non-dominant hand if you need to. With all of the lug nuts removed, slide your busted wheel off of the axle and set it aside. Flip your hubcap upside down to turn it into a small bowl and set your lug nuts inside so that you don’t lose them. Use the proper body mechanics when dismounting a tire. Mounting and dismounting a tire is very tiresome and heavy on your back so you always want to make sure you squat using your legs with your back straight. Never place your legs under the vehicle while it's lifted up because that's a safety hazard. If you can, grab a small mechanics chair as this will help secure your back. 9. The side of the spare with the valve stem on it faces out. Line the lug nut bolts up with the openings on the spare and slide the spare on to the axle - holding the tires at the positions of 4 and 8, lifting the tire slightly and pulling the tire out. The valve stem is the little rubber pipe that sticks out where you add air to the tire. If it’s pointed inward towards the body of the vehicle, the tire is backwards. Fun fact, the spare tire is also known as a “donut.” Take one of the bolts you removed from the old tire, take your spare tire, and align the sockets on the tire rim with the sockets on the tire mount, then place the tire on the mount. Insert the bolt into the topmost socket and rotate the bolt into its socket enough to ensure the tire will not fall off the mount, but not too tightly as to fully insert the bolt into the socket. Grab the tire using proper body mechanics (this is important for your physical health) by getting down on one knee and rolling the tire onto your foot. Carefully lift with your arms and foot to align the tire with the hub. Align the tire with the wheel hub. Press the tire and wheel against the hub so that it sits completely flushed and symmetrical with the hub bearing (this is important for tightening reasons). Keep your foot pressed onto the tire to secure it. Begin screwing the lug nuts back on. First, you want to make sure that you're hub cap is securely placed back on. Start with one lug nut and thread it all the way down on the wheel stud to help hold the tire on the hub. 10. Don’t tighten the nuts using the tire iron just yet. Gently slide each over the bolt and tighten it by hand to partially lock them in place. You will tighten the lug nuts again once the car is down and there is no risk of it falling. Just to clarify, use the same lug nuts that were previously on your wheel. You don’t need special lug nuts for the spare. 11. With the wheel on the axle, lower the jack and remove it. Turn the handle or bolt on the jack counterclockwise to begin lowering the vehicle. Continue lowering the vehicle until the tire is comfortably back on the ground. Then, carefully remove the jack from underneath and set it back in your trunk. [8] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Keep your entire body out from underneath the vehicle. If the jack slips your vehicle gets closer to the ground, you don’t want your body underneath it. 12. Completely tighten the nuts until they won’t turn any further. Using the tire iron, tighten each nuts 3-4 times and then move on to the lug nut on the opposite side. Work in a star pattern to ensure the nuts are secured in an even pattern. Continue tightening the nuts in a cycle until all of the lug nuts are completely secure. [9] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source After you’ve tightened each nut, try to tighten each nut one more time to ensure they’re as tight as they can possibly get. Put your busted tire in the trunk alongside the jack and tire iron. 13. Remove and release all of the jacks from the car. Start off by lifting the vehicle up from the jack stands by using the floor jacks. Do this to make sure you are able to remove the jack stands. Remove the jack stands from under the vehicle. Remove the old tire and wheel assembly. Release the pressure from the floor jack by slowly turning the lever to the left and you will start to see the vehicle slowly fall to the ground. Once the vehicle is fully on the ground. Remove the floor jack. Remove wheel chocks. 14. Keep your speed under 50 miles per hour (80 km/h) and don't go further than 50 miles (80 km). If your spare is a full-size tire (rather than a donut), you can drive the same way you normally would. Check your tire pressure and fill your spare with air as needed. This is especially important if the spare has been in your trunk for a while, since it may have leaked a little in storage. [10] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Head to an auto shop as soon as you can. Small punctures can usually be repaired for $15-100. If the tire is not repairable, you may need to buy a replacement tire.",

    "generated_text": "Here’s your **visual guide** (image generated above) and the **separate text instructions** you asked for.\n\n# Text: How to change a flat tire safely on the roadside\n\n## Before you start (safety first)\n\n* Pull well off the road onto flat, solid ground. If you can’t get fully out of traffic or it’s a blind curve, bridge, or narrow shoulder, **call roadside assistance** instead.\n* Turn on **hazard lights**. Put on a **reflective vest** if you have one.\n* Set the **parking brake** (and put the car in Park; manual: 1st gear or Reverse).\n* Place **wheel chocks**/big stones **on both sides** of a tire opposite the flat (e.g., if front-left is flat, chock the right-rear).\n* Get people and pets away from the traffic side. Never crawl under the vehicle.\n\n## Tools you’ll need\n\n* Spare tire (compact “donut” or full-size)\n* Jack and **owner’s-manual jack point locations**\n* Lug wrench (and locking-lug key if you have one)\n* Wheel chocks, gloves, flashlight, and warning triangle/cones (if available)\n\n## Step-by-step\n\n1. **Prep the area**\n   Place a warning triangle 100–200 ft (30–60 m) behind the car if safe to do so.\n\n2. **Expose the lugs**\n   Remove the hubcap/wheel cover if present.\n\n3. **Break the lug nuts loose**\n   With the wheel **still on the ground**, use the lug wrench to loosen each nut about ½–1 turn. Push down with your foot if needed; don’t fully remove them yet.\n\n4. **Position the jack at the correct jack point**\n   Check your manual for the reinforced spot near the flat tire. Never jack on plastic trim or thin metal.\n\n5. **Lift the vehicle**\n   Raise until the flat tire just clears the ground by an inch or two (2–5 cm). Keep your body and limbs out from under the car.\n\n6. **Remove the flat wheel**\n   Spin off the loosened lug nuts and set them in a safe spot (a hubcap works). Pull the wheel straight off the hub.\n\n7. **Mount the spare**\n   Line up the holes with the studs; slide the wheel fully onto the hub. Thread the lug nuts **by hand** until snug.\n\n8. **Initial tighten in a star pattern**\n   Using the wrench, snug the nuts in a **star/ criss-cross** sequence—do not fully torque yet.\n\n9. **Lower the vehicle and final tighten**\n   Lower the car until the tire just contacts the ground and the jack is free. Now fully tighten the nuts in the **same star pattern** until firmly secure. (Later, torque to your vehicle’s spec.)\n\n10. **Stow and check**\n    Put the flat and tools away, remove chocks/triangle, and check the spare’s pressure. For compact spares, **observe the sidewall limits** (often around 50 mph / 80 km/h and short distances). Drive to a tire shop for repair or replacement **as soon as possible**.\n\n## Extra tips\n\n* If a nut won’t budge, apply steady pressure rather than jerky motions; a short pipe over the wrench handle can help (carefully).\n* If the jack sinks on soft ground, place a solid board under it.\n* After 5–10 miles (8–16 km), **re-check lug nut tightness**.\n* If you have **TPMS**, the warning light may stay on until the repaired tire is back on.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can also turn these steps into a printable one-page checklist or add car-specific jack points based on your make/model.\n",

    "question": "How to clean a coffee maker? Provide illustrated steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Disassemble the coffee maker. Remove any parts that come off, such as the pot, the brew basket, and any other removable parts. These part should be cleaned separately from the rest of the coffee maker. 2. Wash the removable parts. Submerge the removable parts in warm, soapy water, and wash them using a dish rag. You can wash removable parts of your coffee maker the same way you would wash dishes. Glass pots can be very breakable. When washing your coffee maker's pot, treat the glass gingerly. Some coffee makers may have parts that can be washed in a dishwasher. Check the instructions manual, if you still have it. If you're unsure if your coffee maker can be washed in the dishwasher, err on the side of caution and hand wash it. 3. Wipe down the outside of the machine. Take a wet, soapy rag and give the outside of the machine a good wipe down. Wipe down the sides and remove any coffee grinds from the warming plate. When you're down, wipe off any soap suds with a clean, damp rag. 4. Reassemble your machine. After all the parts are dry, you can put your coffee machine back together. It is ready to use again. Make a habit of cleaning your coffee maker like this after each use. 5. Add a vinegar and water solution to your coffee maker. [4] X Expert Source Jonathan Tavarez Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview Make a mixture using 2 parts warm water and 1 part white vinegar. [5] X Expert Source Marcus Shields House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview The precise amounts will vary depending on the size of your coffee maker, but make roughly enough to fill the reservoir. Pour the mixture into the reservoir like you normally would with water when making coffee. 6. Let the coffee machine run half a brew cycle. [7] X Expert Source Jonathan Tavarez Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview Turn the coffee machine on. Keep an eye on it as it brews. Once about half the pot is full with the filtered vinegar/water mixture, turn the pot off. 7. Let the coffee maker sit for an hour. Set a timer for an hour. Let the coffee pot sit for this time frame. This will give the vinegar time to sit in the machine and clean out any mold. 8. Complete the brew cycle. After letting the coffee maker sit for an hour, turn the machine back on. Let it run the rest of the brew cycle. [10] X Expert Source Jonathan Tavarez Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview When done, all the vinegar/water mixture should be filtered into the pot. You can pour this mixture down the sink. 9. Run three brew cycles with plain water. Fill your coffee pot with clean water. Pour this into the reservoir and run a complete brew cycle. [12] X Expert Source Jonathan Tavarez Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview When it's done, pour the water out and run two more brew cycles with clean water. This should clean any vinegar out of your coffee maker. 10. Wipe down the coffee maker. After disinfecting the coffee maker, take a clean, damp rag. Wipe down the exterior of the machine to remove any dirt and debris. You should also make sure to remove coffee grinds from the warming plate. 11. Read your instruction's manual. If you still have the instructions manual, read it before cleaning your coffee maker. Most coffee makers can safely be cleaned with a vinegar/water mixture, but it's always a good idea to check first. [15] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source If you don't have the instructions manual, try looking up your model online. You may be able to find an instructions manual on the Internet. 12. Leave the reservoir lid open. Many people keep the reservoir lid closed. However, it's a good idea to leave it open when not in use. This will help dry out the machine, preventing mold and bacteria from growing in a moist environment. 13. Rinse the brew basket in the sink regularly. The brew basket is very susceptible to mold as it gets wet during the brewing process. Make sure you rinse out the brew basket after each use and make a habit of cleaning it each time you do dishes. This will keep your coffee maker mold and germ free.

    "generated_text": "Here’s the explanation (text), separate from the image above:\n\nCars can drive through the Chandelier Tree because a man-made tunnel was carved through the base of this very large coast redwood decades ago as a roadside attraction. The opening removes only a central portion of the trunk, leaving thick “legs” of wood on both sides. Like a stone arch, those side walls carry most of the compressive load down to the roots, so the trunk can still support itself.\n\nBiologically, coast redwoods are unusually resilient: most water and nutrient transport happens in a thin, living layer just under the bark (the cambium and outer sapwood). Even though the tunnel removes wood and bark at the opening, continuous living tissue remains around the sides and back of the trunk, so flow up and down the tree can continue. Redwood heartwood is rot-resistant and the species can compartmentalize wounds, helping the tree survive long term.\n\nTo protect it, the attraction limits traffic to small vehicles, one at a time and at very low speed, minimizing vibration and impact. Modern arborists would not create new “drive-through” trees today, but this one remains as a historic curiosity—surviving thanks to the combination of clever arch-like shaping and the redwood’s natural toughness.\n",

    "question": "How to perform a deadlift with proper form? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Prepare the barbell. Place the barbell on the ground in front of you and add plates according to your strength and fitness level. If it is your first time performing the deadlift, start lighter. It is always easy to add weight later. You want to perfect your form before you test your physical limits. Secure the plates tightly onto the barbell with clips to keep them from slipping around. Beginners usually start lifting just the barbell, since a typical barbell weighs between 25 and 45 pounds on its own. In this case, you'll want to prop the bar up so it's as high on your shins as it would be if it had plates (approximately 6-8 inches). Otherwise, you'll be bending too far down to pull the barbell right off the floor and could injure yourself. When you prop the barbell, be carefully that it can't easily roll off. 2. Set your stance. Step up to the bar so that your feet are approximately shoulder width apart, your toes are pointing forward or slightly outward, and the barbell is at the midpoint of your foot (as if it's dividing the front and the back of your feet in half). 3. Sit back. Pretend there's a short stool behind you; bend your knees and hips and sit back as if you were going to sit on that stool, while you reach down to grab onto the barbell (hands shoulder-width apart). Actively push your knees out; don't let them collapse in. Keep your back straight so your spine is in a neutral position parallel to the floor. Hinge forward from your hips instead of bending from the waist. [1] X Expert Source Melody Sayers, MS, RD, NASM-CPT Registered Dietician & Personal Trainer Expert Interview Bend your knees and hips just enough to reach and grab onto the bar. This is the starting position for the deadlift. Your shins should be pretty vertical and touching the bar. This is a hard position to stay in. As you figure out your form and check all these criteria, sometimes you'll straighten your legs and allow your back to curve to take a little break from this position. If you watch people deadlift, you'll see them do this between deadlifts. Just make sure you get back into this position before you actually lift. 4. Check your grip. Grasp the barbell with your hands slightly more than shoulder width apart, just outside of your legs. Keep your arms straight. Your palms should face your body, and be equally far from the ends of the barbell. It's not uncommon for people to use a mixed grip as they move onto heavier weights, as it affords a stronger grip, but it's generally better to keep things simple as a beginner. For Olympic lifting, some people use the hook grip, which is more secure but is painful at first. It is similar to the overhand grip, except that instead of the thumb over the remaining fingers, it is hooked underneath them. The underhand grip alone is not recommended because it can lead to the rupture of bicep muscle and connecting tendons, especially in people who do not have full flexibility in the elbow joint. 5. Set your starting position. \"Setting\" here means creating tension in your body while you're in the starting position so you use your muscles when you pull the bar up. It's a bit like clenching your body; you don't want to be like a wet noodle at all because then you might pull a muscle or hurt a joint. Always make sure your back is completely flat and straight. Keep your head, shoulders, and back in alignment. [2] X Expert Source Melody Sayers, MS, RD, NASM-CPT Registered Dietician & Personal Trainer Expert Interview If there is any kind of bend in your back, you need to do some flexibility work before deadlifting. If you have someone record you in starting position, you'll be able to see whether your back is straight or not. Your hips should be above your knees and your shoulders should be above the hips while slightly over the bar. Engage your core and keep your weight heavy in your heels. [3] X Expert Source Melody Sayers, MS, RD, NASM-CPT Registered Dietician & Personal Trainer Expert Interview Make sure you are looking at the ground in front of you (about 45 degrees) to avoid strain on your neck when performing the lifting portion of the deadlift. 6. Stand up and bring the bar up with you. Raise your hips and shoulders at the same rate while maintaining a flat back. Keep your abs tight during the whole lift. Begin the movement by lifting the slack out of the bar. This is done by pulling the bar slightly up until you feel resistance. If you are using metal plates, you will hear a slight clanging noise. This engages all of the muscles prior to committing to the lift. Next, lift the weight while pushing through the middle of your foot, straightening your knees while pulling your shoulders and head back, and pushing your hips forward after the bar has reached just below the knee. The bar should drag along your shins on the way up--that's why a lot of people who deadlift wear pants or knee-high socks, and if they don't, they often have bruises or scrapes to show for it. Come to a standing position with upright posture and your shoulders pulled back (don't let your shoulders cave forward, think of always pinching your shoulders back together and sticking your chest up and out). Don't bend backwards at all, just stand up straight. Engage (squeeze) your hamstrings and glutes to pull the bar up. Avoid locking your knees. [4] X Expert Source Melody Sayers, MS, RD, NASM-CPT Registered Dietician & Personal Trainer Expert Interview 7. Lower the bar. Keeping your back straight, return the bar to the starting position in a controlled manner. Push your butt out as if you are going to sit down in a chair. Do not arch your back or curl your tailbone under. [5] X Expert Source Melody Sayers, MS, RD, NASM-CPT Registered Dietician & Personal Trainer Expert Interview Release the weight after it is on the ground. 8. Place two dumbbells on either side of your body. The dumbbells should be slightly in front of your feet. Make sure that the weight of your dumbbells is appropriate for your strength. 9. Position yourself properly. Your feet should be spread slightly wider than your shoulders. Point your toes forward. You could also point them slightly outward; the result will be the same. 10. Squat down and grasp the dumbbells. You should squat with a flat, neutral back. Make sure that your shoulders are pulled away from your ears. Keep your head in line with your spine, though if it more comfortable you can tilt your chin up slightly. Make sure that your gaze remains straight ahead (if your eyes wander, so will your head, which will in turn shift your spine.) Make sure that your chest is lifted. Make sure that your heels stay firmly on the floor, and that your shoulders are slightly in front of the balls of your feet. 11. Keep your core strong while you stand up. Your abs help stabilize your spine when you begin to lift the dumbbells. Straighten your knees and then your hips before coming to a fully upright position. Your elbows should be straight and the dumbbells should rest by your sides against your thighs. Your hips and shoulders should rise up and straighten at the same time. You should try to keep the dumbbells as close to your body as possible while you straighten up. 12. Hinge at the knees to lower the dumbbells back down. Your hips should move backwards and down as you begin to squat back down to the ground. Try to avoid bending your knees so that they are far ahead of your toes. Keep your back straight and avoid curling your tailbone in or arching your back. Make sure to keep your abs strong and engaged while you lower back down. Keep your shoulders back and lowered while you do this lift and squat.",

Hinge to the bar & grip\n\n* Push hips back to reach the bar while keeping your back neutral.\n* Then bend knees until shins lightly touch the bar (bar stays over midfoot).\n* Grip: double-overhand to start; use hook or mixed grip only when the weight gets heavy.\n\n3. Set your back & brace\n\n* “Chest up, lats tight” (pull shoulder blades down toward your back pockets).\n* Take a deep belly breath and brace your core as if preparing for a gentle punch.\n* Hips slightly above knees; shoulders just in front of the bar; neck neutral.\n\n4. Drive the floor away\n\n* Push through midfoot/heels to break the bar from the floor.\n* **Hips and chest rise together**; keep the bar close—dragging up shins and thighs.\n\n5. Finish (lockout)\n\n* As the bar passes the knees, drive hips forward and squeeze glutes to stand tall.\n* Knees and hips fully extended, ribs down. **Do not lean back** or shrug.\n\n6. Lower & reset\n\n* Hinge first (hips back) to slide the bar down your thighs to knee level.\n* Then bend knees to return the bar to the floor over midfoot.\n* Release breath, re-brace, and repeat each rep from a dead stop.\n\n### Quick cues\n\n* “Midfoot, lats tight, big breath, push the floor, keep bar close.”\n\n### Common mistakes to avoid\n\n* Rounding the lower back; hips shooting up first; bar drifting forward; bouncing reps; hyperextending at lockout.\n\n### Safety & loading\n\n* Start light and master the pattern: 3–5 sets of 3–5 reps with 1–3 reps in reserve.\n* If anything hurts (sharp/pinching pain), stop and consult a qualified coach or clinician.\n",

Respiration involves taking in air filled with oxygen into the human body or lungs and releasing carbon dioxide from the body. Respiration involves breathing through the nose/nasal cavity. The air then travels down into the lungs through the pharynx, followed by the larynx and finally through the trachea. The lungs are located in the chest cavity or thoracic cavity along with the heart. The chest cavity are covered by ribs on the outside. The pleura lines the thoracic cavity and envelopes the lungs. The trachea is subdivided into two bronchi before it enters the lungs. The bronchi are further divided into tiny bronchioles inside the lungs. The bronchioles have a tree like structure. The lungs are separated from the abdominal cavity by the diaphragm. The diaphragm contracts while breathing in and relaxes when breathing out.

Inhalation (breathing in)\n\n* The diaphragm contracts and moves downward while the external intercostal muscles lift the ribs.\n* This expands the chest cavity, lowering the pressure inside the lungs below outside air pressure.\n* Air flows in through the **nose or mouth** → **pharynx** (throat) → **larynx** (voice box) → **trachea** (windpipe) → splits into **right and left bronchi** → smaller **bronchioles** → tiny air sacs called **alveoli**.\n\n2. Gas exchange in the alveoli\n\n* Each alveolus is wrapped in a web of capillaries.\n* **Oxygen (O₂)** diffuses from the air in the alveoli into the blood (where it binds to hemoglobin).\n* **Carbon dioxide (CO₂)** diffuses from the blood into the alveoli to be exhaled.\n\n3. Exhalation (breathing out)\n\n* The diaphragm relaxes and moves upward; the rib cage falls.\n* Chest volume decreases, pressure inside the lungs rises above outside air pressure.\n* Air flows out along the same path in reverse: **alveoli → bronchioles → bronchi → trachea → larynx → pharynx → nose/mouth**.\n* At rest this is mostly passive; during hard breathing, abdominal and internal intercostal muscles actively squeeze air out.\n\n4. Built-in protections & helpers\n\n* **Nasal hairs, mucus, and cilia** trap dust and pathogens and sweep them upward to be swallowed or coughed out.\n* The **epiglottis** guides food away from the airway when you swallow.\n* **C-shaped cartilage rings** in the trachea keep it open.\n\n5. Quick glossary\n\n* **Diaphragm:** dome-shaped muscle under the lungs that powers breathing.\n* **Alveoli:** tiny air sacs where gas exchange happens.\n* **Bronchi/bronchioles:** branching airways that distribute air within the lungs.\n\nIf you’d like, I can add callouts for common issues (like asthma narrowing the bronchioles) or show how exercise changes breathing mechanics.\n\n*(The labeled diagram image is provided separately above.)*\n",

    "reference_text": "This diagram shows the ionic bonds in lithium fluoride molecule. An ionic bond is the force of attraction that holds together positive and negative ions. The lithium fluorine molecule consists of one lithium atom and one fluorine atom with the chemical formula of LiF. The lithium ion has one more proton than the number of electrons thus has the charge of +1. The fluorine ion has one more electron than the number of protons thus has the charge of -1. The lithium ion and fluorine ion have equal but opposite charges so they attract each other. By the attracting force, they form a lithium fluoride molecule.",

It’s not a “shared pair” (like in a covalent bond); it’s a non-directional Coulombic attraction between opposite charges.\n\n**How it forms in lithium fluoride (LiF):**\n\n1. **Start with neutral atoms**\n\n* Lithium (Li): 1s² 2s¹ → one valence electron.\n* Fluorine (F): 1s² 2s² 2p⁵ → seven valence electrons.\n\n2. **Electron transfer**\n\n* Lithium loses its single 2s valence electron:\n  Li → Li⁺ + e⁻\n* Fluorine gains that electron to complete an octet:\n  F + e⁻ → F⁻\n\n3. **Ionic attraction and crystal**\n\n* The resulting ions attract strongly: Li⁺ + F⁻ → **LiF(s)**.\n* In the solid, countless Li⁺ and F⁻ ions pack into a rock-salt lattice, where each Li⁺ is surrounded by six F⁻ (and vice versa). This **lattice energy** makes LiF very stable, hard, and high-melting.\n\n**Why it happens**\nLithium easily gives up its loosely held valence electron (low ionization of the outer electron), while fluorine strongly attracts an extra electron (high electron affinity). The large electronegativity difference drives electron transfer; the lattice’s electrostatic stabilization locks the ions into the solid.\n\n---\n\n*Image is shown above.

Most ocean carbon is stored as bicarbonate/carbonate, buffering the atmosphere.\n3. **Biological pump:** Phytoplankton photosynthesize; part of their organic matter and the **CaCO₃ shells** from calcifying organisms sink, carrying carbon to the **deep ocean**. Much is respired at depth (CO₂ stored for decades–centuries) and later **upwells** back to the surface and air.\n\n## 3) Route from plant carbon → **fossil fuels** (slow cycle)\n\nOnly a tiny fraction of plant carbon escapes decomposition and fire:\n\n1. **Rapid burial in anoxic settings:** In swamps, peatlands, deltas, or marine muds, dead plant/algal matter is buried faster than it decays. Low oxygen slows microbes.\n2. **Diagenesis & maturation (heat + pressure + time):**\n\n   * **Terrestrial plants → peat → lignite → coal.**\n   * **Marine algae/zooplankton → organic-rich muds → kerogen → oil & natural gas.**\n3. **Geologic storage:** These hydrocarbons remain trapped in rocks for millions of years unless exposed, uplifted, or extracted.\n\n## 4) Weathering, rocks, and volcanoes (slow geologic loop)\n\n1. **Silicate weathering (atmosphere → rivers → ocean):** CO₂ in rainwater forms weak acid that weathers rocks; dissolved bicarbonate flows to the ocean.\n2. **Carbonate formation:** Marine organisms and chemistry turn bicarbonate into **limestone/dolomite (CaCO₃/MgCO₃)** that gets buried as rock.\n3. **Subduction & degassing:** Tectonics carry carbonates and organic sediments into the mantle; **volcanoes** and metamorphism return CO₂ to the atmosphere.\n\n## 5) Human accelerators\n\n* **Fossil fuel extraction & combustion → atmosphere:** Moves carbon from the slow reservoir (coal/oil/gas) to the fast one as CO₂.\n* **Cement production:** Releases CO₂ when limestone is calcined.\n* **Deforestation & land-use change:** Reduces photosynthetic uptake and releases stored biomass/soil carbon.\n* **Methane leaks & agriculture:** Add CH₄, which later becomes CO₂.\n* **Permafrost thaw/peatland drainage:** Frees long-stored organic carbon as CO₂/CH₄.\n* **Ocean uptake & acidification:** Extra atmospheric CO₂ drives more dissolution, shifting seawater chemistry and affecting calcifiers.\n\n## 6) Direct answers to your two “where does plant carbon go?” questions\n\n* **Into the atmosphere:** through plant/animal **respiration**, **microbial decay** (CO₂/CH₄), **fires**, and **human burning** of biomass or extracted fossil fuels.\n* **Into fossil fuels:** when dead plant (or algal) material is **rapidly buried in oxygen-poor sediments**, then **cooked by heat and pressure** for **geologic timescales**, transforming into **coal (mainly land plants)** or **oil/gas (mainly marine algae/zooplankton)**.\n\nIf you’d like, I can tailor a simpler “student cheat-sheet” version or add typical timescales and example environments for each arrow.\n",

These adapter layers are designed to modify the data flow from the base model, allowing for the adaptation of the model without needing to modify the base layers extensively. This is done by inserting small, trainable parameters into a frozen model, enabling efficient fine-tuning on specific tasks.\n",

The key idea is to use a Siamese network structure, where both augmented views are passed through separate encoders.

This allows the model to learn by comparing the predictions of the two augmented views, pushing them to match without relying on negative samples.\n\nIn the training process, the model uses a loss function (usually cosine similarity) that minimizes the distance between the predictions from the two views.\n",
