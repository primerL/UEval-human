    "reference_text": "1. 1. Draw a long curved line to form the top of the head and the front of the trunk. Outline the triangular shape of the eye using curved lines, then shade the round pupil inside. Detail the skin above and below the eye with curved lines. 2. 2. Use overlapping curved lines to sketch the trunk, mouth, and jaw. Notice the tusk overlapping the trunk. To draw the tusk, extend a curved line from just in front of the mouth and double it back upon itself. 3. 3. Complete the trunk using a long curved line. Note the “C” shape of the prehensile tip of the trunk. Then, enclose the ear using a long curved line. 4. 4. Enclose the remaining ear and trunk, using a curved line for each. Detail the ears with curved lines, and use another curved line to begin sketching the elephant’s chest. 5. 5. Draw the foreleg. Use a pair of roughly parallel curved lines that form a loose zigzag shape. Connect them at the bottom with a curved line. Use “U” shaped lines to indicate the toenails. 6. 6. Draw the rear leg. Again, use a pair of curved lines and connect them at the bottom. Detail the toes with “U” shaped lines. Connect the tops of each leg with a curved line, forming the belly. 7. 7. Draw the remaining foreleg. Use curved lines and connect them at the bottom. Then, extend a long curved line from the ear to the top of the rear leg to enclose the body. Detail the shoulder and hip with curved lines. 8. 8. Use a curved line to enclose the remaining rear leg, partially hidden behind the first. Draw the toenails on both the front and rear legs. Extend two curved lines from the back of the body and allow them to meet at a point, forming the tail. 9. 9. Use curved lines that meet at jagged points to enclose a tuft of hair at the tip. 10. Color your cartoon elephant. Elephants are usually brown or grey.",

Lightly sketch a ground line.\n\n2. Ear & trunk guides\n   Attach two large teardrop shapes on the sides of the head for ears. From the center of the face, curve an “S” line outward for the trunk path. Add a light vertical guideline down the head and a horizontal one for eye placement.\n\n3. Block in features\n   Loosely outline the head, following the circle. Shape the trunk along your guide with a rounded tip. Mark a tiny smile line and two small ovals for cheeks.\n\n4. Define the ears\n   Trace clean, thick, rounded outlines over the ear guides. Add a second inner line to suggest the inner ear.\n\n5. Body & legs\n   Neck: a short curve from head to body. Draw two front leg stubs, then a back leg peeking from behind. Add a curved belly line.\n\n6. Details\n   Add two big oval eyes with small highlights, a tiny tail curl, and short toe splits. Optional: tiny tusks peeking beside the trunk.\n\n7. Clean-up\n   Erase construction lines. Smooth any wobbly edges so the silhouette reads clearly.\n\n8. Finish\n   Flat color: soft gray body, pink inner ears/cheeks; black eyes. Add the lightest ground shadow under the feet.\n\nQuick tips\n• Keep the head larger than the body for cuteness.\n• Place eyes low on the head and spaced widely.\n• Trunk overlaps the cheek—use that overlap to show depth.\n• If it looks stiff, slightly tilt the head and vary ear sizes a touch.\n\nIf you want any changes to the style (cuter/chibi, more realistic, side view, etc.), tell me and I’ll regenerate a new visual step sheet to match!\n",

    "reference_text": "1. 1. Begin the fish tank outline by drawing a large rectangle. This indicates the front glass of the aquarium. On top of it, draw a long, narrow trapezoid. This forms the top of the aquarium and gives it a three-dimensional appearance. 2. 2. Begin creating the underwater scene . Draw small, round, irregular shapes in one corner to indicate a pile of pebbles. Then, draw a wavy curved line along the bottom of the tank, forming the ground or sediment. From the back corners of the trapezoid, extend vertical straight lines. These indicate the back corners of the aquarium. Notice that they don't go all the way down; the empty spaces will soon be filled with other objects. 3. 3. Draw the base of the aquarium. Use straight lines to draw the tops of the sides and the sides and bottom of the front. Then, draw a straight, horizontal line across the top of the base. 4. 4. Next, draw a castle for the fish to hide in. For the turret or tower, start with the triangle-shaped roof. Then, use curved lines for the sides, midsection, and the \"U\" shaped windows. Use curved lines to draw the central section of the castle, noting the large \"U\" shaped door. Texture the castle with full and partial rectangles, simulating bricks. 5. 5. Draw a watchtower at the top of the castle. Use small trapezoids to create the raised sections of the parapet. Connect them with curved lines, fully enclosing the castle. Then, begin drawing coral. Use curved lines to enclose the branching, tree-like shape. Finally, sketch sand along the side of the aquarium using a curved line. 6. 6. Complete the coral, using curved lines. Texture it with small \"C\" shaped lines. Then, draw the sediment at the back and side of the fish tank using a long curved line. 7. 7. Draw a plant or seaweed. For each leaf, extend two curved lines upward from the sediment. Allow them to cross back and forth over one another, enclosing several segments, before they finally meet at a point. Use curved lines to enclose and texture a seashell , as well as texturing the sand. 8. 8. Introduce the fish into their new home! Use curved lines to sketch the fish's mouth, eye, pectoral fin, body, tail, and dorsal fin. Texture the fins with curved lines. Then, draw a few circular bubbles so that the fish has plenty of air to breathe. 9. 9. Complete your fish tank outline by drawing the final fish. Follow the same steps as with the previous fish. Enclose a few more bubbles, then use wavy lines to sketch a rectangular shape at the top of the tank. This is the waterline. 10. Color your cartoon aquarium. We've shaded the aquatic residents orange to indicate that they are goldfish .",

Draw the box\n\n* Lightly sketch a rectangle for the front.\n* Add a slightly offset rectangle behind it.\n* Connect the corners to make a clear, 3-D tank.\n\n2. Define glass edges\n\n* Darken the outer edges you want visible.\n* Keep the far back edges lighter or dashed so it still reads as glass.\n\n3. Add the waterline\n\n* Draw a horizontal line a bit below the top rim, slightly wavy for realism.\n* Show the line on the side planes too so it wraps around in 3-D.\n\n4. Pour in substrate\n\n* From the bottom back corner, sketch a gentle mound toward the front.\n* Keep edges soft; it’s sand or gravel.\n\n5. Place hardscape\n\n* Add a few smooth rocks (ovals) and a piece of driftwood (bent cylinder).\n* Overlap shapes to create depth.\n\n6. Plant it\n\n* Draw simple leaf clusters: long tapered leaves for vallisneria; bushy ovals for small plants.\n* Vary heights and angles.\n\n7. Add a fish\n\n* Start with an almond/teardrop body, triangle tail, small dorsal and pelvic fins.\n* Place one fish near the middle so it’s easy to see. Add a tiny circle eye and a small mouth.\n\n8. Equipment & bubbles\n\n* Sketch a heater or filter as a slim rectangle on a back corner.\n* Add a few bubbles rising from the substrate or filter.\n\n9. Clean-up & line weight\n\n* Erase construction lines that pass through the fish and foreground objects.\n* Thicken the front rim and foreground objects slightly; keep far edges thin.\n\n10. Shine & texture (optional color)\n\n* Add a thin highlight along the front glass edge and a couple of soft vertical streaks.\n* Dot the gravel, add light shading under rocks/plants, and, if coloring, keep water pale blue and glass mostly white with subtle reflections.\n\nWant another version (cartoony, realistic, or top-view aquascape)?

    "question": "How to bake cookies from scratch? Provide a visual guide and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Keep everything cold. If you are using butter in your cookies (and even, to a certain degree, if you aren't) you will want to keep your ingredients refrigerator-cold. This will make your cookies much more firm and keep them from spreading out in the oven. This means that you'll have to warm up the butter enough to work with it by placing it on the counter, rather than in the microwave. Absolutely never melt it in order to mix it into the dough. A great practice is to cool your dough in the fridge for an hour before rolling it out. 2. Always cream butter and sugar. If your recipe calls for butter and doesn't specifically prohibit this practice, you should always \"cream\" the butter and the sugar first. This is a process by which you mix the two until a sort of paste is formed. 3. Try to use salted butter. Sweet cream butter tends to make cookies taste too sweet. The salt will balance out the sweetness of the cookie just enough to make it taste much better over all. You won't be able to properly taste the salt, but believe us, you'll notice the difference. 4. Change the recipe to alter the final product. If you find a recipe that you love the taste of but want a different texture, it is totally possible to alter the recipe just a bit in order to get exactly what you want! Experiment, or try these tricks: Use cake flour instead of regular flour, shortening instead of butter (or for part of the butter), or about 2 teaspoons of cornstarch along with 4 teaspoons less flour in order to get fluffy, cakey, and softer cookies. Use 2 tablespoons of milk, an extra tablespoon or two of butter, or switch your white sugar for brown to get a crispy cookie. Use melted butter to mix dough and then chill it before baking (undercook a minute or two) to get a chewy cookie. You can also use only yolks, instead of whites. Using a rubber spatula often helps speed up the mixing process if you are not using a machine. 5. Weigh your ingredients. If you find that you still struggle with getting your recipe to turn out right, bake like the pros (and Europeans!) do and weigh your ingredients. Get a good electronic kitchen scale and do your recipe based on weight. This will help ensure the perfect cookie. 6. Use an ice cream scoop to make cookies even. If you want to make sure that every cookie in a batch turns out looking the same, use an ice cream scoop to get perfectly equal balls of dough. 7. Use parchment paper. Skip the Silpat in favor of parchment paper. Silpat can make it difficult for cookies to cook evenly and it also keeps the bottoms from developing that perfect crispness. Parchment paper turns out a much better cookie. 8. Bake on the bottom of your cookie sheet. If you notice that the cookies at the edge of your sheet are prone to getting over cooked, use an Round or oval pan. If you don't have one, improvise and flip the pan over to use the bottom! 9. Know your oven. Every oven is different and it is important for you to know how yours behaves. If you know what to expect, then you can find ways to work around the expected problems. For example, if you notice that cookies on one corner or side bake faster than in another, make sure you turn the pan part-way through the baking process. 10. Start with a cold pan. Put your baking sheet in the fridge to cool before you put each set of cookies on. If you want to save time, you can scoop the dough onto parchment paper and store them in the fridge until they are ready to go out on a cooled pan. This means cooling the pan between each set of 12 too! 11. Don't overbake your cookies. If anything it's better to under-bake them. For the first batch carefully watch them and time for when they get the first hint of brown at the edges. Edge browning usually means you've gone too far, though these cookies are still perfectly good (especially if you like yours crispy!). Once you know how long it takes to reach that point, pull them out maybe 30 seconds before they brown for perfectly soft cookies. If you are using white chocolate chips in your cookies, be careful, as they can burn particularly easily. 12. Let cookies sit on the pan. Let your cookies sit on the pan for a few minutes before taking them off. This will let them firm up on the bottom, making them much easier to remove.",

    "question": "How to organize your closet? Provide illustrated steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Remove all of the clothes from your closet. Take all of your clothes off their hangers and out of any bins or drawers in your closet. Fold them in piles on the floor or on your bed. This includes your shoes as well. It may also include other accessories such as belts, scarves, purses, or ties. 2. Decide which clothes you will keep. You may have the urge to keep everything, or toss everything. But go through systematically and piece by piece to really scrutinize your clothing. What you want in your closet are clothes that you wear on a regular basis, that fit you and are functional, and fit in the space available. Does the item fit? Clothing in the closet should fit you properly, neither too loose nor too tight. It typically means it is comfortable, not pinching, clothing can button easily, and no red marks left on the skin. It may also mean letting go of items no longer in fashion, such as skin tight skirts you really should not wear to your professional job. It is usually best to let go of \"inspirational items\" such as the jeans you hope to someday fit back into; trends being what they are the item may well be out of fashion when you do lose the weight. One pair of \"fat pants\" may be OK to remind you of your weight loss accomplishment. If your weight is fluctuating up or down (such as in growing young adults, pregnant women, or dieters) this may be tricky. Still, get rid or store items that clearly do not fit you. Do I wear this? Have you worn the item in the last year? How often do you wear it: once a week or only once this year? If you have not worn the item in a long time, that may well indicate it is time to let go. Special use items may be OK to keep even if used only periodically. You might have a Christmas sweater, or interview outfit, or formal dress that isn't used often but still worth having available. Do I like this? If you really don't like an item, do not keep it. In general, do not hang onto items out of guilt--such as that shirt your father bought you but you just do not like. Do I have multiples of this? Work or school uniforms are one thing. But if you have seven black almost identical t-shirts, that might be a sign to let go of a few. Make a \"Keep\" pile for the clothes that you will keep and wear on a regular basis. 3. Decide which clothes you will store. You should store the clothes that you won't be wearing for a while because they aren't seasonally appropriate. If it's the middle of summer, you can store your winter sweaters and scarves, and if it's the dead of winter, you can store your tank tops and summer dresses. You can also store clothes that may have sentimental value for you, such as a shirt your grandmother knitted for you, or an old t-shirt from your high school tennis team that no longer fits. Try to keep the sentimental value clothes to a minimum, though. Clothes are meant to be worn, after all. Consider displaying beloved clothing instead of keeping them in your closet. Consider framing your prized concert T-shirt, or creating a shadow box of your Boy Scout uniform and awards, or make a T-shirt quilt of your old marathon shirts. When you're done sorting through the clothes you will store, put them in a plastic bin or a clear bag marked keep. You can either store them in the back of your closet, under your bed, or in a storage unit or a different part of your home if you have the room. 4. Decide which clothes you will donate or throw out. This is the hardest step, and the most important. If you want to have a truly organized closet, then your goal should be to get rid of as many items of clothing as possible. This doesn't mean you should throw out your favorite things - however, it does mean that you should take a long hard look to ask yourself which clothes you will actually ever wear again. If you haven't worn something in over a year and it has no sentimental value, it's time to donate it. If you have an item that is so worn, covered in moth holes, or faded that you and anyone else will never wear it again, then it's time to throw it out. If you have a few items of clothing that are just way too small, stop waiting for the day that they will fit and donate them. Donate all of the clothes you don't need that are in good condition, or give them to a sibling or friend. 5. Clean the inside of the closet. You should do this before you put back your clothes. Vacuum or sweep the floor, wipe the walls down with all-purpose cleaner, and sweep away any cobwebs that may have accumulated there. If you want to make any changes, such as painting the inside a different color or adding and removing some shelves, do it now. 6. Hang up your clothes and organize them. Try to hang up as many of your clothes as you can. This will make it easier for you to find your clothes and to conserve space. You should not only hang up your clothes, but you should also organize them in a particular way so you can easily find them whenever you need to. Here are some ways to organize the clothes you hang up: Organize your clothes by season. If you've stored away some of your seasonal clothes, organize your clothes by season just for half the year. If it's summer, hang up your summer clothes first, followed by your fall clothes. Organize your clothes by type. You can separate your tank tops, shirts, pants, skirts, and dresses. Organize your work and casual clothes. Separate your work clothes from your casual clothes so you can easily get dressed for work in the morning. Organize your clothes by how often you wear them. You can choose any method of organization, but hang up a few key items, like your favorite hoodie or the pair of jeans you wear all the time, in the most accessible place. If you really want to step it up a notch, you can use differently colored hangers to mark a different type of clothing. For example, you can hang your tops on pink hangers, or your work clothes on green hangers. Colour code your clothes. example in rainbow colours You can also think about installing another pole to hang up your additional clothes. 7. Put additional clothes in other parts of your closet. Once you've hung up all of the clothes fit on your pole, you should find other parts of the closet to store the rest of your clothes. The clothes that you put in the bins should be used less frequently than the clothes you hang up, or they should be clothes that don't need to be hung up, like your workout clothes. Here are a few ideas: Don't waste the space under your hanging clothes. Put a few plastic bins of clothes under the hanging clothing. If you have room for a dresser, consider putting one in your closet. It will save you time and space. Consider installing a closet organizer to find a more efficient way to store your remaining clothes . If you have overhead space, make the most of it. Use it to store bulky sweaters, sweats, and other items that are thick and easy to spot. 8. Organize your shoes. Your shoes may take up a lot of the space in your closet, so once you've chosen which shoes you will keep, it's important to make the most of your space by storing them in the most organized and efficient manner. Here are some ways to organize the shoes in your closet: Organize them by type. Separate your dress shoes, sandals, and boots. Organize them by how often you wear them. Keep your favorite pair of boots, flip-flops, or sneakers in the place with the easiest access. Invest in a shoe rack to place on the floor of your closet. This will make it much easier to find the pair of shoes you want. Try storing your shoes in your overhead space. This is another easy way to save space. If your closet has a door that opens instead of a sliding door, consider getting a hanging shoe rack. If you have a front hall closet, consider putting the shoes you wear the most often there instead to save space in your personal closet. 9. Organize any boxes in your closet. If your closet is big enough, then it's likely that you've stored things other than clothes in it, such as big boxes filled with mementos, old photo albums, and CDs you haven't seen for ten years. To finish organizing your closet, you should go through these old boxes to see what you should keep and what you should toss. Here's how to do it: Get rid of any papers or items you've kept for over a year that have no sentimental value. Consolidate the boxes to save closet space. If your closet is already cramped, consider putting some of the items in a different place, such as putting your old high school yearbooks on the bottom of your bookshelf. If you've been using cardboard boxes, trade them up for plastic bins. They will last longer and will be more visually appealing. Label the boxes or bins so you know what's in them next time you move or organize your things again. 10. Organize any additional items in your closet. Take the time to go through any additional items in your closet to make sure that you still need them and that the closet is really the best place for them. Here are some examples: If you find any towels, sheets, or blankets, put them in your linen closet. If you've had an old lawn chair or another piece of furniture you don't really need hanging out back there, it's time to throw it out. If you've had to pick up an item and spend at least fifteen seconds trying to figure out what the heck it is or why you would need it, it's time to throw it out. Make sure that all of the other items you find belong in the closet and not another part of your home. For example, if you find a box of light bulbs, a box of comic books, or a box of chocolate, ask yourself if those items wouldn't be more logically organized elsewhere. 11. Make your closet more visually appealing. Turn your creativity loose and think of ways to add pleasure to the routine of getting dressed and looking through your closet every day. If you spend more time making your closet look nice, then you will be less likely to let it get messy in the future. Paint your closet a soft pretty color. Add mirrors for sparkle. Hang jewelry and scarves where you can see them -- as long as they don't get in your way. Hang up a small poster or painting that makes you smile every time you open your closet. 12. Enjoy your newly organized closet. Take a step back and admire your hard work! Hopefully, your closet is organized now so that all of its contents are easy to find and its overall appearance is to your liking. If not, take a few more minutes to make any minor changes that still need to be made. From this point forward, try to keep your closet organized as you add to it, or remove and return its current contents. Doing so will prevent you from needing to do another large overhaul on your closet in the future.",

As you go, drop items into: Keep / Donate / Tailor-Fix / Trash / Seasonal. Keep sentimental items in a separate small box.\n\n2. **Declutter Fast**\n   For each item ask: *Do I wear it? Does it fit? Do I love it?* If it fails 2+ questions, let it go. Put donations straight into your car or schedule a pickup.\n\n3. **Measure & Plan Zones**\n   Measure width, height to shelf, and depth. Sketch zones: **Long hang**, **Short hang (double rod if possible)**, **Shelves/Drawers**, **Shoes**, **Accessories**.\n\n4. **Choose the Right Tools**\n\n   * Hangers: one style for tops/bottoms, sturdy for coats.\n   * Shelves: add dividers for stacks.\n   * Bins: clear or labeled for accessories and off-season.\n   * Over-the-door/side-wall hooks for bags, hats, scarves.\n\n5. **Group by Category**\n   Tops → Bottoms → Dresses → Outerwear → Activewear → Accessories → Shoes.

File-fold tees in drawers.\n\n7. **Use Vertical Space**\n   Add a second rod for short items, under-shelf baskets, and stackable boxes on the top shelf. Use floor space for a shoe rack; store rarely used items highest.\n\n8. **Label & Maintain**\n   Label shelves and bins (e.g., “Sweaters,” “Gym,” “Bags”). Do a 5-minute tidy each week; do a seasonal swap twice a year.\n\n## Quick Layout Tips\n\n* **Tiny reach-in:** Double-rod 2/3 of the width; one narrow long-hang section; over-door hooks; under-bed box for off-season.\n* **Standard reach-in:** One long-hang, one double-hang, one shelf stack with dividers; 2–3 clear bins up top.\n* **Walk-in:** U-shape: long-hang on the shortest wall, double-hang on others; drawers/shelves in the center; island only if walk path remains ≥ 36\".\n\n## Maintenance Mini-Routine (10 minutes)\n\n* Return strays, re-fold one stack, re-set hangers to face forward, toss one item you won’t wear, and empty donation bag when it fills.\n\n---\n\n**Image:** I’ve generated an illustrated “Closet Organization in 8 Steps” poster separately for you to use alongside these instructions.",

    "question": "Why can people shop and walk on the Rialto Bridge in Venice? Provide a photo and explain the structural design.",
    "reference_text": "The Rialto Bridge is the oldest stone bridge across the Grand Canal in Venice. Its central arch supports a covered walkway lined with shops. The strong stone arch distributes weight evenly, allowing both commercial activity and pedestrian traffic on top while boats pass underneath.",
    "reference_images": [
      "data/space/rialto_bridge_shops.jpg"
    ],
    "generated_text": "# Explanation (separate from the image)\n\nPeople can shop and walk on the Rialto Bridge because it was conceived not just as a crossing, but as a **marketplace built into a bridge**:\n\n* **Single-span stone arch:** The bridge is a massive masonry arch that works entirely in **compression**. Its curved profile channels the weight of crowds and the shop structures down into the arch and out toward the banks, where the thrust is resisted by very large abutments. Stone excels at compression, so it can safely carry heavy, steady loads like shops plus pedestrian traffic.\n\n* **No piers in the canal:** Because it’s a single span, there’s **no intermediate pier** in the Grand Canal. That keeps the waterway open for boats while concentrating the structure’s strength in the arch and abutments—freeing the deck to host shops and walkways.\n\n* **Three walkways with shops between:** The bridge carries **two rows of small shops** along its length. Those shop walls act like **spandrel walls**, transferring loads down to the arch. Between and beside the shops are **three pedestrian passages**—a central stairway and two outer side walks—so people can browse and pass through at the same time.\n\n* **Deep foundations and stout abutments:** As with many Venetian structures, the abutments are set on **dense fields of timber piles** driven into the lagoon’s sediments, which become very durable in waterlogged, low-oxygen conditions. This spreads the arch thrust over a large area and keeps settlement small.\n\n* **Durable materials and detailing:** The outer shell uses hard, water-resistant **Istrian stone** with brick and stone within, plus a crowned profile and steps that manage the slope. The permanent “dead load” of the shops actually helps **pre-compress** the arch, improving stability against crowds and wind.\n\n* **Designed for commerce from the start:** Built in the **late 16th century** (1588–1591) under **Antonio da Ponte**, it replaced earlier wooden trading bridges. Integrating stalls into the superstructure formalized the Rialto area’s role as Venice’s commercial heart—so the bridge has always been both a thoroughfare **and** a shopping street.\n\nIn short: the Rialto’s **masonry arch + robust foundations + integrated spandrel/shop walls** create a stiff, compression-only structure that easily carries the weight of shops and dense pedestrian traffic, while leaving the canal completely clear below.\n",

    "reference_text": "1. Bend your knees. In essence, \"squatting\" simply means to bend your knees, bringing your backside closer to the floor. For best results, try bending your knees to a 90-degree angle, then standing back up. [1] X Expert Source Dean Theriot Personal Trainer Expert Interview 2. Keep your knees behind your toes. This protects your knees and back and helps you achieve maximum results. When you move into a squat, bend your knees so that they move directly over your feet, without going further than your toes. [3] X Expert Source Dean Theriot Personal Trainer Expert Interview 3. Keep your feet shoulder-width apart. For a standard free squat, start by keeping your feet under your shoulders. This help to avoid stress on your knees. 4. Angle your feet for plié squats. A plié squat is a free squat done with a wide stance. For these, it is important to angle your feet out and to bend your knees so they move directly over your feet. Begin by doing these at only a half-range of motion, and work up to getting your knee bends to 90 degrees. 5. Stop at the bottom. After you build up some leg strength, you may begin to \"break 90,\" or allow your squat to deepen more than a 90-degree bend in your knees. However, it is important to stop when your thighs lightly come into contact with your calves. Going beyond this can place unnecessary stress on your knees.",

    "generated_text": "# Free (Bodyweight) Squat — Text Guide\n\nFollow these clear, safe steps. If anything hurts (sharp pain), stop and adjust range or seek a pro.\n\n## 1) Set Your Stance\n\n* Feet about shoulder-width apart (a little wider or narrower based on comfort).\n* Toes turned slightly out (≈5–20°) so knees can track over them.\n* Distribute weight through the whole foot (heel + big toe + little toe). Look ahead.\n\n## 2) Brace\n\n* Take a deep breath “360°” into your belly and sides.\n* Gently lock ribs down as if prepping for a cough; keep spine neutral.\n* Set shoulders down/back. Lightly squeeze glutes.\n\n## 3) Initiate: Hips Back, Knees Out\n\n* Start the squat by sending the hips slightly back, then let the knees bend.\n* Let knees track in line with the toes (don’t cave inward).\n* Reach your arms forward a bit for balance if helpful.\n\n## 4) Descend Under Control\n\n* Lower smoothly; keep chest proud and back neutral.\n* Keep heels flat; stay balanced over mid-foot.\n* Go as low as **your** mobility allows—aim for thighs parallel to the floor or lower without losing your brace.\n\n## 5) Check the Bottom Position\n\n* Knees track over toes; don’t collapse inward.\n* Weight balanced (not on toes only; heels stay down).\n* Avoid excessive pelvis tuck (“butt wink”). If it appears, stop just above that range.\n\n## 6) Drive Up\n\n* Push the floor away through mid-foot/heels.\n* Stand up by extending hips and knees together (no shooting hips up first).\n* Keep knees tracking over toes; exhale through the sticking point.\n\n## 7) Finish Tall\n\n* Stand tall with hips and knees fully extended.\n* Reset your breath/bracing before the next rep.\n\n---\n\n## Breathing Cue (Simple)\n\n* **Inhale & brace** before you descend → **exhale** as you drive up.\n* For heavier sets, you can hold a gentle brace until you pass the hardest point, then exhale.\n\n## Common Mistakes → Quick Fixes\n\n* **Heels lift:** Widen stance slightly; slow down; work ankle mobility; try a small heel lift (5–10 mm).\n* **Knees cave in:** Think “spread the floor” or “push knees toward pinky toes.”\n* **Back rounds:** Re-brace; keep chest proud; shorten depth slightly; include core work.\n* **Leaning too far forward:** Bring heels under hips; use counterbalance arms; keep gaze forward.\n* **Bouncing/relaxing at bottom:** Pause briefly; keep tension.\n\n## Regressions (Easier)\n\n* **Box/Chair Squat:** Tap a box/chair behind you for depth control.\n* **Supported Squat:** Hold a doorframe/TRX for assistance.\n* **Heel-elevated Squat:** Place thin plates under heels to ease ankle demand.\n\n## Helpful Progressions (Harder)\n\n* **Goblet Squat (light weight)** for counterbalance and torso position.\n* **Tempo Squat:** 3-sec lower, no bounce, smooth up.\n* **Pause Squat:** 1–2 sec hold at the bottom with tension.\n* **Split Squat / Pistol to Box** for single-leg control.\n\n## Suggested Sets & Reps\n\n* Beginners: **3 × 8–10 reps**, rest 60–90 s.\n* Warm-up: 5 min light cardio + 2–3 easy ramp-up sets.\n\n> Goal: Smooth, controlled reps with consistent depth and balance.

    "reference_text": "1. Start in a squatting position. Bend your knees and come close to the floor, almost as though you are going to sit. Hover just above the ground, with your thighs hugging close to your calves. As you get more comfortable with this move, you can start from a standing squat. Eventually you will start from a completely standing position. 2. Round your back. Bend your elbows close to your body so that your hands are by your ears. Tuck your head between your arms and curl your back forwards. As you get more comfortable with the position, you can start with your hands extended out in front of you. 3. Roll backwards. When your head hits the mat, tuck your chin and push the ground with your hands. Think about pushing your body away from the mat with your hands. Be sure to keep your shoulders and arms strong and close to your head. They are your point of strength. 4. Swing your legs over your head. Using the momentum of your legs and the strength of your arms, bring your legs over your head and your feet to the mat. You may have to use your core strength as well. Kick your legs to gain momentum, but squeeze your abs to pull your feet to the mat. 5. Stand up. Once your feet hit the mat, press against the mat with your hands, pushing your upper body up to follow your feet. You will be in a squat with your hands on the mat. Stand up from there, with your arms up. In order to practice for your back extension, you can practice ending in a pushup position instead of a standing position. When your feet hit the mat, press against the mat with your hands and use your ab muscles to straighten out into a plank position. Hold that position to build strength.",

Your torso should hinge freely at the hips.\n   * Lock your ankles under the pads with feet flat on the plate, legs straight but knees soft.\n\n2. **Starting position**\n\n   * Body in a straight line from head to heels; ribs stacked over pelvis.\n   * Cross arms over your chest (easiest). Keep neck neutral (gaze ~1–2 m ahead of the floor).\n\n3. **Brace**\n\n   * Inhale through the nose; lightly brace your abs and squeeze your glutes to set a neutral spine.\n\n4. **Lower (the hinge)**\n\n   * Hinge at the hips and **control** the descent. Let the torso tip forward while keeping your back neutral (don’t round).\n   * Stop when you feel a hamstring stretch or when your torso is slightly below parallel. Tempo idea: ~2–3 seconds down.\n\n5. **Pause**\n\n   * Brief 1-second pause at the bottom while staying tight; keep shoulders away from ears.\n\n6. **Raise**\n\n   * Drive your hips into the pad, squeeze glutes/hamstrings, and lift the torso until it’s **in line** with your legs.\n   * Exhale as you come up. Do **not** hyperextend or arch past straight.\n\n7. **Finish & repeat**\n\n   * Hold the top for half a second in neutral, then repeat for 8–12 smooth reps.\n\n**Progressions & variations**\n\n* Easier: hands on hips → arms across chest.\n* Harder: hands behind head → hold a light plate/dumbbell tight to chest.\n* Tempo challenge: 3–4 sec down, 2-sec pause at bottom, 1 sec up.\n* Range: only as deep as you can keep a neutral spine.\n\n**Common mistakes to avoid**\n\n* Rounding the lower back on the way down.\n* Throwing the torso/swinging to get up.\n* Hyperextending at the top (arching past a straight line).\n* Pad set too high (blocks the hips) or too low (digs into thighs).\n* Craning the neck up; keep it neutral.\n\n**Safety tips**\n\n* If you feel sharp pain (especially in the lower back), stop.\n* Keep motion at the **hips**, not by bending the spine.\n* Start with bodyweight and perfect control before adding load.\n\nIf you want, I can also give steps for a **flat-bench alternative** (no Roman chair) or tailor reps/sets to your program.\n",

    "reference_text": "1. Lie on your right side on a yoga mat. You’ll be putting your weight on your feet and your elbow, so you’ll want something soft beneath you. Spread out so you’re lying on your right side on the floor. If you don’t have a yoga mat, try to do this exercise on carpet or a rug so you have a little bit of cushion beneath you. 2. Put your left foot on top of your right foot. Stick your legs straight out so they’re in line with your glutes, then stack your feet on top of each other. This will help you keep your body straight, so it’s super important! Your feet will be anchoring you to the ground, so it’s really important they stay steady throughout this exercise. 3. Push your right elbow underneath your right armpit. Spread your palm out wide to keep your balance. Your arm will be taking most of your weight, so really dig it into the floor to keep your balance. Make sure your right arm stays at a 90-degree angle from your torso the entire time. 4. Engage your core to lift your hips off the ground. To get into the plank position, squeeze your abs and your glutes tight. Lift your hips up off the ground until your body creates a slanted line from your head down to your feet. If you’re having trouble keeping your balance, place your left hand on your hip. Otherwise, keep it flat along your left side. Keep your hips in a straight line with the rest of your body—don't lift them up or let them sink down. [5] X Expert Source Laila Ajani Fitness Trainer Expert Interview 5. Hold the pose for 6 seconds, then lower your hips. When you’re first starting out, this pose might be tough to hold. Try to go for at least 6 seconds, then slowly lower your hips back to the floor. As you get better, you can try holding your side plank for up to 30 seconds at a time. If you’re having trouble, try exhaling as you lift your hips up and inhaling as you lower down. This will help you engage the right muscles so you can hold the pose for longer. 6. Repeat that 3 to 5 times, then switch to your left side. As you practice this more, you’ll be able to do more reps. When you first start out, try to do the pose 3 to 5 times, then roll over onto your left side and repeat. If you don’t feel exhausted by these reps, you can try doing a few more. On the left side, your left arm and left foot will be underneath your body. 7. Bend your knees if you’re a beginner. If you find the normal side plank to be a little too tough, get into a side plank position, but bend your knees to stick your feet out behind you. Engage your glutes to lift your hips off the floor, and use your knees instead of your feet to keep your balance. [9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source This is a good way to practice the side plank if you’re having trouble keeping your back straight. 8. Do leg raises to engage your obliques. Get into a normal side plank position. Keeping your spine straight, lift your top leg up toward the ceiling, taking it a little bit higher than hip height. Quickly lower your leg back down to complete one repetition. If you’re having trouble keeping your balance, place your outside hand on your hip to keep yourself steady. To really challenge yourself, try holding a dumbbell in your upper hand as you do your leg lifts. Try doing leg lifts 10 to 15 times on each side. 9. Try hip dips to strengthen your lower obliques. Get into a side plank position, then place your left hand on your hip. Slowly lower your hips down toward the floor, stopping just before they touch the ground. Quickly engage your abs to lift your hips back up again for one repetition. You’ll feel this in your abs, your glutes, and your obliques. It’s important to raise back up into a classic side plank position with your spine straight. That way, you won’t lose your posture throughout the exercise. If you’re having trouble with this exercise, do a side plank on your knees and try hip dips that way. Try doing hip dips for 15 to 30 seconds on each side. 10. Do a side plank crunch to work on your abs. Get into a side plank position and lift your hips up off the ground. Pull your upper leg and upper arm in towards your torso to do a crunch on that side of your body. Extend your arm and leg outwards to get out of the crunch and complete one repetition. If you feel yourself starting to rock back and forth, engage your glutes to hold yourself steady. Picture this like you’re doing a classic crunch, except now you’re on your side. Start out by doing crunches for 15 to 30 seconds on each side. 11. Work on your balance with an oblique twist. Lie on your side in a side plank position. Lift your hips off the ground, then put your outer hand up by your ear. Slowly turn in toward the floor, stopping yourself when you’re looking directly at your lower forearm. Twist back around to get into your side plank position. These twists engage your entire body, so they’re a great overall workout. Twist 10 to 15 times on each side. 12. Try a side plank slide to challenge yourself. Get into a side plank position. Slowly slide your feet outwards, keeping your spine straight and your weight on your elbow. Tilt your arm so it’s at an angle to work your obliques, then hold the pose for a few seconds. Engage your obliques to slide back upwards into a normal side plank. This move can be a little tough on your elbow, so put a pillow or a foam mat underneath your arm if you need to. Try to keep your spine straight the entire time to get the most out of this workout. Work up to doing slides for 15 to 30 seconds on each side.",

Lead with the inside foot up, drive hips back slightly, then bring the trail foot up. Step down the way you came.\n   * **Easier:** use the lowest step.\n   * **Harder:** pause for 1 second balanced at the top.\n\n4. **Incline Push-Ups — 2 sets of 8–12**\n\n   * Hands on a step (higher step = easier). Body in a straight line, elbows at ~45°. Lower chest toward the step; press back.\n   * **Easier:** move hands to a higher step.\n   * **Harder:** move to a lower step.\n\n5. **Incline Plank Step Taps — 2 sets of 20 alternating taps**\n\n   * Hands on a step in a strong plank. Lift one hand to tap the next higher step, place it back, then switch. Keep hips steady.\n   * **Easier:** widen your stance.\n   * **Harder:** slower tempo or tap two steps up.\n\n6. **Calf Raises — 2 sets of 12–15**\n\n   * Stand on the edge of a step holding the railing lightly. Drop heels slightly below the step, then rise onto the balls of your feet and pause.\n   * **Easier:** both feet.\n   * **Harder:** single-leg.\n\n7. **Toe Taps (Cardio) — 3 rounds of 30–45 sec, 15 sec rest**\n\n   * Rapidly tap the bottom step with alternating feet. Stay light and upright.\n   * **Easier:** slower pace.\n   * **Harder:** pump arms or extend to 60 sec.\n\n8. **Cool-Down (2–3 minutes)**\n\n   * **Calf stretch:** hands on rail, heel down on bottom step, 20–30 sec/side.\n   * **Quad stretch:** stand tall, hold the rail, pull heel to glute, 20–30 sec/side.\n   * **Hamstring stretch:** heel on step, hip hinge with flat back, 20–30 sec/side. Breathe slowly.\n\n# How to structure it\n\n* Do steps **2–7** as a circuit; rest **30–45 sec** between moves.\n* Complete **2–3 circuits** depending on time/fitness.\n\n# Form cues to remember\n\n* Tall chest, ribs down, and brace your core before stepping.\n* Knee tracks roughly over the second/third toe.\n* Move quietly—control down as much as up.\n* Stop if you feel sharp pain or dizziness; consult a pro if you have heart, balance, or joint concerns.\n\nIf you want, tell me your space (number/height of steps and any equipment) and I can tailor reps, progressions, and a weekly plan.\n",

Above that, lighter gases become more common (start of the **heterosphere**).\n* **Ionosphere:** Not a separate “layer” by altitude alone; it **overlaps** the mesosphere/thermosphere (\\~60–1,000 km) and is defined by ionization from solar radiation (important for auroras and radio).\n\nIf you’d like, I can add typical Celsius/°F scale values on the temperature curve or include example altitudes for planes, balloons, meteors, the ISS, and GPS satellites.\n",

As a hollow, muscular pump, its main function is to propel blood throughout the body. The septum is the wall of muscle divides it down the middle, into a left half and a right half. There are 4 chambers in the heart: top chamber is called atrium; bottom chambers are called ventricles. Blood can flow from the atrium to ventricle because of openings called valves. Valves open in one direction like trapdoors to let the blood pass through, then they close, so the blood cannot flow backwards into the atria. There are also valves at the bottom of the large arteries that carry blood away from the heart: the aorta and the pulmonary artery. These valves keep the blood from flowing backward into the heart once it has been pumped out. Blood vessels of the body carry blood in a circle: moving away from the heart in arteries, traveling to various parts of the body in capillaries, and going back to the heart in veins. All the blood from the body is eventually collected into the two largest veins: the superior vena cava, which receives blood from the upper body, and the inferior vena cava, which receives blood from the lower body region.",

In optics, a ray is an idealized model of light, obtained by choosing a line that is perpendicular to the wave fronts of the actual light, and that points in the direction of energy flow. Rays are used to model the propagation of light through an optical system by dividing the real light field up into discrete rays that can be computationally propagated through the system by the techniques of ray tracing. All three rays should meet at the same point. The Principal Ray or Chief Ray in an optical system is the meridional ray that starts at the edge of the object and passes through the center of the aperture stop. This ray crosses the optical axis at the locations of the pupils. The Central Ray is perpendicular to infrared radiation. The Focal Ray is drawn from the tip of the object through (or towards) the focal point, reflecting off the mirror parallel to the principal axis.",

    "question": "How to set up a Gmail account? Provide a visual guide and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Go to https://accounts.google.com in a browser. This will open the Google Account sign-in page. If you already have a Google account, you’ll need to sign out before you can continue. 2. Click Create account . You’ll find this small blue link near the bottom of the page, next to the Next button. 3. Select your account type from the menu. A menu will pop up with a few options to choose from. Select either For my personal use , For my child , or For work or my business . If you’re trying to create a business account, you might want to consider signing up for a Google Workspace account instead. The process for creating a child’s account is very similar to creating a personal account for yourself. You’ll need to provide information such as your child’s name, birthdate, and desired email address. However, you’ll also need to sign in with your Gmail account to provide parental consent for their account. 4. Enter your first and last name. Type your first name into the \"First name\" text box, then enter your last name in the \"Last name\" box underneath it. You must enter a first name, but the last name is optional. If you're creating a Gmail account for a friend or a child, enter their information in the fields provided. 5. Enter your birth date and gender. On the next page, you’ll be prompted to provide your birthdate (month, day, and year) and gender. If you don’t identify as male or female, select Custom to see additional options. You can also select Rather not say . Click Next when you’re done. Google asks for your birthdate because some Google services have specific age requirements. Google may also use this information to personalize your experience. If you decide to provide your gender, Google will use this information to personalize your account—e.g., by using your preferred pronouns in text that refers to you. 6. Select or create a custom email address. On the next page, you’ll be offered some automatically generated email addresses based on your name. If you don’t want any of those, select Create your own Gmail address and type in your preferred username. You can use a combination of letters, numbers, and periods. This is the text that will appear before “@gmail.com” in your email address. Click Next when you’re done. You must enter a unique username that isn't being used by someone else. If it's taken, you'll see: That username is taken. Try another. If the username you want is taken, add a number at the end or change the spelling. Sometimes Google will reject a username if it’s extremely similar to one that somebody else is using (even if there are slight differences), if someone else had that username in the past and then deleted it, or if Google has reserved the name to prevent abuse or spam. 7. Enter and confirm your new password. Type your preferred password into the \"Password\" text box, then type the same password into the \"Confirm\" box underneath it. Check the Show password box to see what you are typing. Click Next when you’re done. These passwords must match before you can proceed. Make sure to use a strong password to avoid any unauthorized access to your account. 8. Enter a recovery email. Google will contact you at your recovery email address if something goes wrong with your new account—e.g. if you get locked out or Google detects unusual activity from your address. Click Next when you’re done. If you don’t have an alternate email, or if you’d rather set up recovery options later, click Skip . 9. Review your info and select Next . On the next page, you’ll see your new account name and email address. If it looks good, click Next . Otherwise, you can use your browser’s Back button to go back and make changes to the information you entered in the previous steps. 10. Agree to the Terms of Service. On the next page, you’ll be prompted to agree to Google’s terms and privacy policy. Once you’ve reviewed them, click I agree . If you change your mind, click Cancel instead. 11. Confirm your personalization options. A window will pop up asking if you want to agree to Google’s personalization options. Click Confirm to continue, or select More options to change your settings. 12. Customize your account settings. Once you verify your new address, you’ll be taken to the Google Account home page. From here, you can adjust settings such as: Your account recovery information. Add a recovery email here if you didn’t already, or add a phone number so you have two recovery options. Set a home address for a more personalized experience. For example, Google will show you weather reports and map results based on your address. Adjust your privacy and security settings and review privacy recommendations for your account. Add contacts or set up a family group. 13. Go to https://mail.google.com to access your Gmail. You should be automatically logged into your new account. If not, you’ll be prompted to sign in. The first time you visit this page, you’ll see options to customize your inbox, set a profile image, and add or import contacts. To write and send an email, click Compose in the top left corner. To see your emails, click the Inbox tab on the left side of the page. Use the tabs at the top of your inbox on the right to view different categories such as regular emails (in Primary ), marketing related emails (in Promotions ), or email notifications from various social media platforms (in Social ). In the menu on the left, you can also browse your drafts, sent emails, scheduled messages, your spam folder, and more. Adjust your settings by clicking the Settings icon at the top right side of the page. To sign out of your account, tap your initial or profile picture at the top right corner of the page, then select Sign Out .",

They are often differentiated by a filled-in sun (decrease) and an empty sun (increase) or a sun with dots for rays (decrease) and a sun with lines for rays (increase). Also be on the lookout for arrows pointing upwards or downwards, indicating an increase or decrease in brightness. These hotkeys will be mapped onto different buttons on different keyboards. Check out your left and right arrow keys, or the function keys (F1, F2, etc.) lining the top of your keyboard. 2. Hold down the \"Fn\" key on your keyboard.

Open the Settings app and tap Wi-Fi to find and connect to a wireless network. 2. Open the App Store . This looks like a white A with a blue background. You can usually find this on your home screen or in the App Library. Be sure to update your iPad to the latest version. If you don't see the App Store on your device, you may have parental controls enabled. If you're the device owner, you can easily turn it off . Otherwise, you'll need to contact the owner. 3. Tap your Apple ID picture. This will be in the top-right corner of the screen. A pop-up menu will open. 4. Scroll down to view apps. You'll see a list of installed apps underneath Upcoming Automatic Updates . By default, automatic updates are turned on. If it isn't you can always enable it . 5. Tap Update . This will be next to the app you need to update. If you want to update all available apps at once, tap Update All above the list of apps. When the app is finished updating, it will disappear from the list.",
