    "reference_text": "1. 1. Draw a long curved line to form the top of the head and the front of the trunk. Outline the triangular shape of the eye using curved lines, then shade the round pupil inside. Detail the skin above and below the eye with curved lines. 2. 2. Use overlapping curved lines to sketch the trunk, mouth, and jaw. Notice the tusk overlapping the trunk. To draw the tusk, extend a curved line from just in front of the mouth and double it back upon itself. 3. 3. Complete the trunk using a long curved line. Note the “C” shape of the prehensile tip of the trunk. Then, enclose the ear using a long curved line. 4. 4. Enclose the remaining ear and trunk, using a curved line for each. Detail the ears with curved lines, and use another curved line to begin sketching the elephant’s chest. 5. 5. Draw the foreleg. Use a pair of roughly parallel curved lines that form a loose zigzag shape. Connect them at the bottom with a curved line. Use “U” shaped lines to indicate the toenails. 6. 6. Draw the rear leg. Again, use a pair of curved lines and connect them at the bottom. Detail the toes with “U” shaped lines. Connect the tops of each leg with a curved line, forming the belly. 7. 7. Draw the remaining foreleg. Use curved lines and connect them at the bottom. Then, extend a long curved line from the ear to the top of the rear leg to enclose the body. Detail the shoulder and hip with curved lines. 8. 8. Use a curved line to enclose the remaining rear leg, partially hidden behind the first. Draw the toenails on both the front and rear legs. Extend two curved lines from the back of the body and allow them to meet at a point, forming the tail. 9. 9. Use curved lines that meet at jagged points to enclose a tuft of hair at the tip. 10. Color your cartoon elephant. Elephants are usually brown or grey.",

Lightly sketch a ground line.\n\n2. Ear & trunk guides\n   Attach two large teardrop shapes on the sides of the head for ears. From the center of the face, curve an “S” line outward for the trunk path. Add a light vertical guideline down the head and a horizontal one for eye placement.\n\n3. Block in features\n   Loosely outline the head, following the circle. Shape the trunk along your guide with a rounded tip. Mark a tiny smile line and two small ovals for cheeks.\n\n4. Define the ears\n   Trace clean, thick, rounded outlines over the ear guides. Add a second inner line to suggest the inner ear.\n\n5. Body & legs\n   Neck: a short curve from head to body. Draw two front leg stubs, then a back leg peeking from behind. Add a curved belly line.\n\n6. Details\n   Add two big oval eyes with small highlights, a tiny tail curl, and short toe splits. Optional: tiny tusks peeking beside the trunk.\n\n7. Clean-up\n   Erase construction lines. Smooth any wobbly edges so the silhouette reads clearly.\n\n8. Finish\n   Flat color: soft gray body, pink inner ears/cheeks; black eyes. Add the lightest ground shadow under the feet.\n\nQuick tips\n• Keep the head larger than the body for cuteness.\n• Place eyes low on the head and spaced widely.\n• Trunk overlaps the cheek—use that overlap to show depth.\n• If it looks stiff, slightly tilt the head and vary ear sizes a touch.\n\nIf you want any changes to the style (cuter/chibi, more realistic, side view, etc.), tell me and I’ll regenerate a new visual step sheet to match!\n",

    "reference_text": "1. 1. Begin the fish tank outline by drawing a large rectangle. This indicates the front glass of the aquarium. On top of it, draw a long, narrow trapezoid. This forms the top of the aquarium and gives it a three-dimensional appearance. 2. 2. Begin creating the underwater scene . Draw small, round, irregular shapes in one corner to indicate a pile of pebbles. Then, draw a wavy curved line along the bottom of the tank, forming the ground or sediment. From the back corners of the trapezoid, extend vertical straight lines. These indicate the back corners of the aquarium. Notice that they don't go all the way down; the empty spaces will soon be filled with other objects. 3. 3. Draw the base of the aquarium. Use straight lines to draw the tops of the sides and the sides and bottom of the front. Then, draw a straight, horizontal line across the top of the base. 4. 4. Next, draw a castle for the fish to hide in. For the turret or tower, start with the triangle-shaped roof. Then, use curved lines for the sides, midsection, and the \"U\" shaped windows. Use curved lines to draw the central section of the castle, noting the large \"U\" shaped door. Texture the castle with full and partial rectangles, simulating bricks. 5. 5. Draw a watchtower at the top of the castle. Use small trapezoids to create the raised sections of the parapet. Connect them with curved lines, fully enclosing the castle. Then, begin drawing coral. Use curved lines to enclose the branching, tree-like shape. Finally, sketch sand along the side of the aquarium using a curved line. 6. 6. Complete the coral, using curved lines. Texture it with small \"C\" shaped lines. Then, draw the sediment at the back and side of the fish tank using a long curved line. 7. 7. Draw a plant or seaweed. For each leaf, extend two curved lines upward from the sediment. Allow them to cross back and forth over one another, enclosing several segments, before they finally meet at a point. Use curved lines to enclose and texture a seashell , as well as texturing the sand. 8. 8. Introduce the fish into their new home! Use curved lines to sketch the fish's mouth, eye, pectoral fin, body, tail, and dorsal fin. Texture the fins with curved lines. Then, draw a few circular bubbles so that the fish has plenty of air to breathe. 9. 9. Complete your fish tank outline by drawing the final fish. Follow the same steps as with the previous fish. Enclose a few more bubbles, then use wavy lines to sketch a rectangular shape at the top of the tank. This is the waterline. 10. Color your cartoon aquarium. We've shaded the aquatic residents orange to indicate that they are goldfish .",

Draw the box\n\n* Lightly sketch a rectangle for the front.\n* Add a slightly offset rectangle behind it.\n* Connect the corners to make a clear, 3-D tank.\n\n2. Define glass edges\n\n* Darken the outer edges you want visible.\n* Keep the far back edges lighter or dashed so it still reads as glass.\n\n3. Add the waterline\n\n* Draw a horizontal line a bit below the top rim, slightly wavy for realism.\n* Show the line on the side planes too so it wraps around in 3-D.\n\n4. Pour in substrate\n\n* From the bottom back corner, sketch a gentle mound toward the front.\n* Keep edges soft; it’s sand or gravel.\n\n5. Place hardscape\n\n* Add a few smooth rocks (ovals) and a piece of driftwood (bent cylinder).\n* Overlap shapes to create depth.\n\n6. Plant it\n\n* Draw simple leaf clusters: long tapered leaves for vallisneria; bushy ovals for small plants.\n* Vary heights and angles.\n\n7. Add a fish\n\n* Start with an almond/teardrop body, triangle tail, small dorsal and pelvic fins.\n* Place one fish near the middle so it’s easy to see. Add a tiny circle eye and a small mouth.\n\n8. Equipment & bubbles\n\n* Sketch a heater or filter as a slim rectangle on a back corner.\n* Add a few bubbles rising from the substrate or filter.\n\n9. Clean-up & line weight\n\n* Erase construction lines that pass through the fish and foreground objects.\n* Thicken the front rim and foreground objects slightly; keep far edges thin.\n\n10. Shine & texture (optional color)\n\n* Add a thin highlight along the front glass edge and a couple of soft vertical streaks.\n* Dot the gravel, add light shading under rocks/plants, and, if coloring, keep water pale blue and glass mostly white with subtle reflections.\n\nWant another version (cartoony, realistic, or top-view aquascape)?

    "question": "How to bake cookies from scratch? Provide a visual guide and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Keep everything cold. If you are using butter in your cookies (and even, to a certain degree, if you aren't) you will want to keep your ingredients refrigerator-cold. This will make your cookies much more firm and keep them from spreading out in the oven. This means that you'll have to warm up the butter enough to work with it by placing it on the counter, rather than in the microwave. Absolutely never melt it in order to mix it into the dough. A great practice is to cool your dough in the fridge for an hour before rolling it out. 2. Always cream butter and sugar. If your recipe calls for butter and doesn't specifically prohibit this practice, you should always \"cream\" the butter and the sugar first. This is a process by which you mix the two until a sort of paste is formed. 3. Try to use salted butter. Sweet cream butter tends to make cookies taste too sweet. The salt will balance out the sweetness of the cookie just enough to make it taste much better over all. You won't be able to properly taste the salt, but believe us, you'll notice the difference. 4. Change the recipe to alter the final product. If you find a recipe that you love the taste of but want a different texture, it is totally possible to alter the recipe just a bit in order to get exactly what you want! Experiment, or try these tricks: Use cake flour instead of regular flour, shortening instead of butter (or for part of the butter), or about 2 teaspoons of cornstarch along with 4 teaspoons less flour in order to get fluffy, cakey, and softer cookies. Use 2 tablespoons of milk, an extra tablespoon or two of butter, or switch your white sugar for brown to get a crispy cookie. Use melted butter to mix dough and then chill it before baking (undercook a minute or two) to get a chewy cookie. You can also use only yolks, instead of whites. Using a rubber spatula often helps speed up the mixing process if you are not using a machine. 5. Weigh your ingredients. If you find that you still struggle with getting your recipe to turn out right, bake like the pros (and Europeans!) do and weigh your ingredients. Get a good electronic kitchen scale and do your recipe based on weight. This will help ensure the perfect cookie. 6. Use an ice cream scoop to make cookies even. If you want to make sure that every cookie in a batch turns out looking the same, use an ice cream scoop to get perfectly equal balls of dough. 7. Use parchment paper. Skip the Silpat in favor of parchment paper. Silpat can make it difficult for cookies to cook evenly and it also keeps the bottoms from developing that perfect crispness. Parchment paper turns out a much better cookie. 8. Bake on the bottom of your cookie sheet. If you notice that the cookies at the edge of your sheet are prone to getting over cooked, use an Round or oval pan. If you don't have one, improvise and flip the pan over to use the bottom! 9. Know your oven. Every oven is different and it is important for you to know how yours behaves. If you know what to expect, then you can find ways to work around the expected problems. For example, if you notice that cookies on one corner or side bake faster than in another, make sure you turn the pan part-way through the baking process. 10. Start with a cold pan. Put your baking sheet in the fridge to cool before you put each set of cookies on. If you want to save time, you can scoop the dough onto parchment paper and store them in the fridge until they are ready to go out on a cooled pan. This means cooling the pan between each set of 12 too! 11. Don't overbake your cookies. If anything it's better to under-bake them. For the first batch carefully watch them and time for when they get the first hint of brown at the edges. Edge browning usually means you've gone too far, though these cookies are still perfectly good (especially if you like yours crispy!). Once you know how long it takes to reach that point, pull them out maybe 30 seconds before they brown for perfectly soft cookies. If you are using white chocolate chips in your cookies, be careful, as they can burn particularly easily. 12. Let cookies sit on the pan. Let your cookies sit on the pan for a few minutes before taking them off. This will let them firm up on the bottom, making them much easier to remove.",

    "question": "How to organize your closet? Provide illustrated steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Remove all of the clothes from your closet. Take all of your clothes off their hangers and out of any bins or drawers in your closet. Fold them in piles on the floor or on your bed. This includes your shoes as well. It may also include other accessories such as belts, scarves, purses, or ties. 2. Decide which clothes you will keep. You may have the urge to keep everything, or toss everything. But go through systematically and piece by piece to really scrutinize your clothing. What you want in your closet are clothes that you wear on a regular basis, that fit you and are functional, and fit in the space available. Does the item fit? Clothing in the closet should fit you properly, neither too loose nor too tight. It typically means it is comfortable, not pinching, clothing can button easily, and no red marks left on the skin. It may also mean letting go of items no longer in fashion, such as skin tight skirts you really should not wear to your professional job. It is usually best to let go of \"inspirational items\" such as the jeans you hope to someday fit back into; trends being what they are the item may well be out of fashion when you do lose the weight. One pair of \"fat pants\" may be OK to remind you of your weight loss accomplishment. If your weight is fluctuating up or down (such as in growing young adults, pregnant women, or dieters) this may be tricky. Still, get rid or store items that clearly do not fit you. Do I wear this? Have you worn the item in the last year? How often do you wear it: once a week or only once this year? If you have not worn the item in a long time, that may well indicate it is time to let go. Special use items may be OK to keep even if used only periodically. You might have a Christmas sweater, or interview outfit, or formal dress that isn't used often but still worth having available. Do I like this? If you really don't like an item, do not keep it. In general, do not hang onto items out of guilt--such as that shirt your father bought you but you just do not like. Do I have multiples of this? Work or school uniforms are one thing. But if you have seven black almost identical t-shirts, that might be a sign to let go of a few. Make a \"Keep\" pile for the clothes that you will keep and wear on a regular basis. 3. Decide which clothes you will store. You should store the clothes that you won't be wearing for a while because they aren't seasonally appropriate. If it's the middle of summer, you can store your winter sweaters and scarves, and if it's the dead of winter, you can store your tank tops and summer dresses. You can also store clothes that may have sentimental value for you, such as a shirt your grandmother knitted for you, or an old t-shirt from your high school tennis team that no longer fits. Try to keep the sentimental value clothes to a minimum, though. Clothes are meant to be worn, after all. Consider displaying beloved clothing instead of keeping them in your closet. Consider framing your prized concert T-shirt, or creating a shadow box of your Boy Scout uniform and awards, or make a T-shirt quilt of your old marathon shirts. When you're done sorting through the clothes you will store, put them in a plastic bin or a clear bag marked keep. You can either store them in the back of your closet, under your bed, or in a storage unit or a different part of your home if you have the room. 4. Decide which clothes you will donate or throw out. This is the hardest step, and the most important. If you want to have a truly organized closet, then your goal should be to get rid of as many items of clothing as possible. This doesn't mean you should throw out your favorite things - however, it does mean that you should take a long hard look to ask yourself which clothes you will actually ever wear again. If you haven't worn something in over a year and it has no sentimental value, it's time to donate it. If you have an item that is so worn, covered in moth holes, or faded that you and anyone else will never wear it again, then it's time to throw it out. If you have a few items of clothing that are just way too small, stop waiting for the day that they will fit and donate them. Donate all of the clothes you don't need that are in good condition, or give them to a sibling or friend. 5. Clean the inside of the closet. You should do this before you put back your clothes. Vacuum or sweep the floor, wipe the walls down with all-purpose cleaner, and sweep away any cobwebs that may have accumulated there. If you want to make any changes, such as painting the inside a different color or adding and removing some shelves, do it now. 6. Hang up your clothes and organize them. Try to hang up as many of your clothes as you can. This will make it easier for you to find your clothes and to conserve space. You should not only hang up your clothes, but you should also organize them in a particular way so you can easily find them whenever you need to. Here are some ways to organize the clothes you hang up: Organize your clothes by season. If you've stored away some of your seasonal clothes, organize your clothes by season just for half the year. If it's summer, hang up your summer clothes first, followed by your fall clothes. Organize your clothes by type. You can separate your tank tops, shirts, pants, skirts, and dresses. Organize your work and casual clothes. Separate your work clothes from your casual clothes so you can easily get dressed for work in the morning. Organize your clothes by how often you wear them. You can choose any method of organization, but hang up a few key items, like your favorite hoodie or the pair of jeans you wear all the time, in the most accessible place. If you really want to step it up a notch, you can use differently colored hangers to mark a different type of clothing. For example, you can hang your tops on pink hangers, or your work clothes on green hangers. Colour code your clothes. example in rainbow colours You can also think about installing another pole to hang up your additional clothes. 7. Put additional clothes in other parts of your closet. Once you've hung up all of the clothes fit on your pole, you should find other parts of the closet to store the rest of your clothes. The clothes that you put in the bins should be used less frequently than the clothes you hang up, or they should be clothes that don't need to be hung up, like your workout clothes. Here are a few ideas: Don't waste the space under your hanging clothes. Put a few plastic bins of clothes under the hanging clothing. If you have room for a dresser, consider putting one in your closet. It will save you time and space. Consider installing a closet organizer to find a more efficient way to store your remaining clothes . If you have overhead space, make the most of it. Use it to store bulky sweaters, sweats, and other items that are thick and easy to spot. 8. Organize your shoes. Your shoes may take up a lot of the space in your closet, so once you've chosen which shoes you will keep, it's important to make the most of your space by storing them in the most organized and efficient manner. Here are some ways to organize the shoes in your closet: Organize them by type. Separate your dress shoes, sandals, and boots. Organize them by how often you wear them. Keep your favorite pair of boots, flip-flops, or sneakers in the place with the easiest access. Invest in a shoe rack to place on the floor of your closet. This will make it much easier to find the pair of shoes you want. Try storing your shoes in your overhead space. This is another easy way to save space. If your closet has a door that opens instead of a sliding door, consider getting a hanging shoe rack. If you have a front hall closet, consider putting the shoes you wear the most often there instead to save space in your personal closet. 9. Organize any boxes in your closet. If your closet is big enough, then it's likely that you've stored things other than clothes in it, such as big boxes filled with mementos, old photo albums, and CDs you haven't seen for ten years. To finish organizing your closet, you should go through these old boxes to see what you should keep and what you should toss. Here's how to do it: Get rid of any papers or items you've kept for over a year that have no sentimental value. Consolidate the boxes to save closet space. If your closet is already cramped, consider putting some of the items in a different place, such as putting your old high school yearbooks on the bottom of your bookshelf. If you've been using cardboard boxes, trade them up for plastic bins. They will last longer and will be more visually appealing. Label the boxes or bins so you know what's in them next time you move or organize your things again. 10. Organize any additional items in your closet. Take the time to go through any additional items in your closet to make sure that you still need them and that the closet is really the best place for them. Here are some examples: If you find any towels, sheets, or blankets, put them in your linen closet. If you've had an old lawn chair or another piece of furniture you don't really need hanging out back there, it's time to throw it out. If you've had to pick up an item and spend at least fifteen seconds trying to figure out what the heck it is or why you would need it, it's time to throw it out. Make sure that all of the other items you find belong in the closet and not another part of your home. For example, if you find a box of light bulbs, a box of comic books, or a box of chocolate, ask yourself if those items wouldn't be more logically organized elsewhere. 11. Make your closet more visually appealing. Turn your creativity loose and think of ways to add pleasure to the routine of getting dressed and looking through your closet every day. If you spend more time making your closet look nice, then you will be less likely to let it get messy in the future. Paint your closet a soft pretty color. Add mirrors for sparkle. Hang jewelry and scarves where you can see them -- as long as they don't get in your way. Hang up a small poster or painting that makes you smile every time you open your closet. 12. Enjoy your newly organized closet. Take a step back and admire your hard work! Hopefully, your closet is organized now so that all of its contents are easy to find and its overall appearance is to your liking. If not, take a few more minutes to make any minor changes that still need to be made. From this point forward, try to keep your closet organized as you add to it, or remove and return its current contents. Doing so will prevent you from needing to do another large overhaul on your closet in the future.",

As you go, drop items into: Keep / Donate / Tailor-Fix / Trash / Seasonal. Keep sentimental items in a separate small box.\n\n2. **Declutter Fast**\n   For each item ask: *Do I wear it? Does it fit? Do I love it?* If it fails 2+ questions, let it go. Put donations straight into your car or schedule a pickup.\n\n3. **Measure & Plan Zones**\n   Measure width, height to shelf, and depth. Sketch zones: **Long hang**, **Short hang (double rod if possible)**, **Shelves/Drawers**, **Shoes**, **Accessories**.\n\n4. **Choose the Right Tools**\n\n   * Hangers: one style for tops/bottoms, sturdy for coats.\n   * Shelves: add dividers for stacks.\n   * Bins: clear or labeled for accessories and off-season.\n   * Over-the-door/side-wall hooks for bags, hats, scarves.\n\n5. **Group by Category**\n   Tops → Bottoms → Dresses → Outerwear → Activewear → Accessories → Shoes. Keep sets (suit pieces) together.\n\n6. **Arrange Smart**\n\n   * **Frequency:** everyday items at eye/hand level; occasion or off-season up high.\n   * **Color order (light → dark)** within each category.\n   * Face items the same way; one item per hanger. File-fold tees in drawers.\n\n7. **Use Vertical Space**\n   Add a second rod for short items, under-shelf baskets, and stackable boxes on the top shelf. Use floor space for a shoe rack; store rarely used items highest.\n\n8. **Label & Maintain**\n   Label shelves and bins (e.g., “Sweaters,” “Gym,” “Bags”). Do a 5-minute tidy each week; do a seasonal swap twice a year.\n\n## Quick Layout Tips\n\n* **Tiny reach-in:** Double-rod 2/3 of the width; one narrow long-hang section; over-door hooks; under-bed box for off-season.\n* **Standard reach-in:** One long-hang, one double-hang, one shelf stack with dividers; 2–3 clear bins up top.\n* **Walk-in:** U-shape: long-hang on the shortest wall, double-hang on others; drawers/shelves in the center; island only if walk path remains ≥ 36\".\n\n## Maintenance Mini-Routine (10 minutes)\n\n* Return strays, re-fold one stack, re-set hangers to face forward, toss one item you won’t wear, and empty donation bag when it fills.\n\n---\n\n**Image:** I’ve generated an illustrated “Closet Organization in 8 Steps” poster separately for you to use alongside these instructions.",

    "question": "How to connect a Wi-Fi network on a laptop? Provide a visual guide and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Get a wireless router. Most ISPs will supply you with both a Wi-Fi router and modem, or a Wi-Fi router/modem combo. If your ISP only provides a modem, or you don't want to rent a Wi-Fi router from them, you can buy your own. Various factors will determine which router is best for you, including speed, bandwidth capabilities, and Wi-Fi coverage/distance. Speed These days, all wireless routers (even the budget models) are pretty fast. If you need ultra-fast Wi-Fi speeds—perhaps multiple devices will be streaming movies in 4k or 8k, gaming, or sharing large amounts of data at the same time—opt for a router with Wi-Fi 7 technology . If you're on a budget and want blazingly fast but don't need extreme , opt for a Wi-Fi 6 router . Distance If you have a very large home, consider a mesh router system instead of a standalone Wi-Fi router. Mesh Wi-Fi systems consist of a router with a series of nodes to expand the coverage in all areas of your home. 2.4GHz or 5Ghz 2.4 GHz covers a wider distance, is supported by more devices, and is good at penetrating walls and large furniture. However, it's more prone to interference because more devices (including cordless phones) use this frequency. 5 GHz is faster and less prone to interference, but it does have a smaller coverage area and cannot penetrate solid objects as well as 2.4GHz. Security The highest level of security is WPA3, but some devices (including Nintendo Switch) don't support it. Choose a router that has a WPA2/WPA3 Transitional mode, which allows newer devices to use WPA3 and older devices to use WPA2. 2. Connect the modem to the appropriate port on your wall. If you have a separate modem, connect it to the DSL, cable, or fiber port on your wall using the cable provided to you by your ISP, and turn the unit on. If the modem and router are one unit, connect that to the wall port, and turn the unit on. 3. Connect the router to your modem and turn it on. If the router is separate from the modem, you'll need to connect it to the modem using an ethernet cable. Plug one end of the cable into the port on the back of the router labeled WAN/WLAN/Internet or similar, and the other end into the modem's LAN port. 4. Place your router. For the best possible signal , position the wireless router in a central location, away from walls and metal objects, and not on the floor. [3] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source Any obstacles will degrade the signal. Remember that it must be physically connected to your modem, so this may limit your options when placing the router. 5. Connect your computer or phone to the router. Some routers have a mobile app you can install that makes Wi-Fi setup a breeze—check your router's documentation to see if you can download an app and use it to set up your router. If not, you'll need to connect your computer to the router using an ethernet cable to set up your wireless network. 6. Log in to the router's admin page. If you connected your computer via ethernet, you'll need to open the router's configuration page and sign in with the admin password. Open a web browser and enter the router's web address. According to Showers, the IP address is typically https://192.168.1.1, https://192.168.0.1, or https://10.0.0.1, but can vary based on the router model. [4] X Expert Source Tyrone Showers Technologist Expert Interview Consult the documentation that came with the router to find the exact address. The router will ask you for a login name and password, or sometimes just a password. The password you'll need to use is in your router's documentation or sometimes printed on a sticker on the back of the router. If you bought a used router, you can find the default admin password for most routers at https://portforward.com/router-password . 7. Enter your internet connection information. In most cases, your router should obtain this information automatically from your modem. If it doesn't, you may need to enter some information about your internet connection—often a username and password and DNS server addresses. If you're not sure what to enter, contact your ISP. 8. Set up your Wi-Fi access point. Locate the Wireless or Wi-Fi section of your router's configuration page. You can enable Wi-Fi, change the network name, and set the security level here. The \"SSID\" field is where you'll enter a name for your Wi-Fi router. This is the name people will see when they want to connect to the internet. If you live in an area with a lot of public traffic, avoid putting any identifiable information in the SSID, as anyone with a wireless device can see it. Make sure to set the security/encryption to the latest version allowed by your router. This will most likely be WPA3 (best) or WPA2 (less good, but more compatible with older devices). Create a password for your Wi-Fi network. While this is not required, Showers recommends it. \"Creating a strong password, combining letters, numbers, and special characters is important to enhance security,\" he says. [5] X Expert Source Tyrone Showers Technologist Expert Interview 9. Apply your settings. Make sure you click the Apply or Save Changes button in your router's configuration when you are done changing the settings. The router will process for a moment (or reboot), and your new settings will take effect. 10. Connect your devices to Wi-Fi. Once the router is online, you can connect your Wi-Fi capable devices so they can access the internet. Android Swipe down from the top of the screen. Tap and hold the Wi-Fi icon to open your Wi-Fi settings. Slide the \"Wi-Fi\" switch to \"ON\" (or tap the option to Use Wi-Fi ). Select your Wi-Fi network name. iPhone or iPad Open Settings . Tap Wi-Fi . Tap the switch ON . Select your Wi-Fi network's name. Windows 10/11 Click the network icon in the taskbar, which usually looks like a Wi-Fi fan or similar to the bars you normally see at the top of your cell phone. It may be a globe if you're not currently connected. Click your Wi-Fi network's name. Click Connect . Mac Click the Wi-Fi icon (the fan) in the menu bar. Select your Wi-Fi network. 11. Enter the password. Type the password you created when configuring your Wi-Fi router, and click Connect or similar. Once the password is accepted, your device will be connected to the Wi-Fi access point. 12. Test your internet connection. Once you are connected to the network, wait a moment for your IP address to be assigned. Open a web browser and try to connect to a website you don't normally visit to ensure you aren't loading the website from memory.",

    "question": "How to Hold a Ping Pong Paddle? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Fit the blade of the paddle in the space between your thumb and index finger. If you look at your hand you’ll see the “V” shape that your thumb and index finger form. Place the paddle in your hand and move it so that its inside right bottom edge rests in that “V”. 2. Wrap your middle, ring, and pinky fingers around the handle. These are the only fingers you use to hold the ping paddle handle with a shakehand grip. These fingers should look similar to how they look when you’re shaking someone’s hand. Try moving the paddle up and down in a hand-shaking motion to the feel for this grip. 3. Rest your index finger against the outside of the paddle. Again, think of shaking someone’s hand. Your index finger is usually pointed outwards instead of curled in. This will help stabilize the paddle when you swing. If it feels more comfortable, let the tip of your finger rest against the side edge. 4. Curl your thumb around the front of the handle if you want greater wrist flexibility. This is called a shallow shakehand grip, and it's probably the most natural grip for beginners. It’s great for high freedom of movement for the paddle, which will make returning the ball easier. While this grip is usually pretty natural feeling, if it doesn't feel right to you, that may be a sign to try something else. 5. Rest your thumb against the front face of the paddle if you want a firmer grip. While this deep shakehand grip limits wrist flexibility, it works well for precise shots that don’t need a lot of power. Holding your paddle this way will also make it easy to switch the paddle from side to side, so it's great for both forehand and backhand shots. You can always switch between this thumb position and wrapping your thumb around the handle to get the benefits of both! 6. Keep your grip loose. Of course you want to grip the paddle firmly enough so it doesn’t fly out of your hand when you play, but a person should still be able to grab the paddle from you with only slight resistance. A too-tight grip will limit wrist flexibility too much making it difficult to hit or spin the ball. The paddle should feel like a natural extension of your arm, moving as freely as you move your hand. 7. Hold the paddle so its edge is perpendicular to the ground. You’ll notice your wrist tilts slightly downward. While the angle of the paddle will shift as you play, you want your wrist to stay in this position. Avoid floppy wrists when you swing! This will lead to you mis-hitting the ball. You need your entire forearm to swing and if you move your wrists around too much they’ll get tired. 8. Rest the handle in the space between your thumb and index finger. See the “V” shape formed by your thumb and index finger. With the handle angled upwards, rest its edge inside that “V” the way you would a pen. 9. Grip the handle between your thumb and index finger. Form a loop around the handle. Imagine writing with the paddle like a pen or pencil, and try moving it around in a pen writing motion to get a feel for the grip. 10. Keep your remaining fingers relaxed if you want greater wrist flexibility. For the Chinese penhold grip, lightly grip the outside face of the paddle with the tips of your middle, ring, and pinky fingers. Keep your fingers in a relaxed position. Holding the paddle this way will give you a wide range of motion and make it easy to block and push the ball. This grip makes it hard to consistently use backhand topspin or the spinning of the ball using the outside part of the paddle. 11. Straighten your middle, ring, and pinky fingers for more powerful strokes. For the Korean/Japanese penhold grip, the edge of your middle finger should lightly grip the outside face of the paddle with your ring and pinky stacked on top of it. You want your fingers to be rigidly straight. Holding the paddle this way will let you easily return a ball when standing far away from the table. Straight fingers can restrict paddle blade movement, making it harder for you to switch the paddle angle to reach the ball. 12. Use the “V” grip for high power and ball spin. Hold the blade of the paddle between your index and middle finger, forming a “V” shape. Place your thumb where it feels most comfortable. This grip ideal for wide-angle shots. Keep in mind that isn’t as popular as the penhold or shakehand grip, so finding a coach that specializes in it can be hard. 13. Block effectively with the Seemiller grip. Wrap your fingers around the handle of the paddle and rest your index finger on its back face as close to the bottom edge as you can get it. Use your thumb to grip the paddle blade with your index finger from the other side. Since backhand wrist flexibility is limited for this style, you may want to make backhand shots using the forehand side of your paddle. 14. Achieve heavy topspin with the reverse penhold grip. Hold the paddle handle between your thumb and index finger and rest your remaining three fingers against the paddle's outside face, keeping them relaxed. Angle the paddle in your hand slightly up so you can use both sides of the paddle to hit the ball. This grip is very similar to other penhold grips. The difference comes down to the angle you hold paddle and your style of play, and it's not unusual to see this grip combined with the Chinese or Korean/Japanese penhold styles.",

    "generated_text": "Here are your step-by-step **text instructions** (the visual is provided separately above).\n\n# Shakehand grip (most common)\n\n1. Start neutral\n   Hold the handle like a handshake. Keep your wrist relaxed and the blade (paddle face) roughly vertical.\n\n2. Thumb & index placement\n   Rest your **thumb lightly on the forehand rubber** near the handle. Lay your **index finger across the backhand rubber**, roughly horizontal. They should form a soft “V” along the top of the handle bevel.\n\n3. Wrap the other fingers\n   Curl the remaining three fingers around the handle. Leave a small gap (about a fingertip) between your palm and the handle’s butt—no choking up, no palming the blade.\n\n4. Set pressure points\n   Apply gentle pressure mainly with **thumb and index**. Keep the other fingers loose so the wrist can move freely.\n\n5. Angle for strokes\n   For **forehands**, let the index side relax so the blade can close slightly. For **backhands**, add a touch more pressure with the thumb to open the blade. Adjust in millimeters, not inches.\n\n6. Quick checks\n   Blade makes ~90° with your forearm at rest; wrist feels free; you can wiggle the blade without it slipping.\n\n# Penhold grip (popular in East Asia)\n\n1. Pinch the neck\n   Pinch the front of the blade with **thumb and index** as if holding a pen. The “circle” they form sits just above the handle.\n\n2. Rear-finger support\n   Place the **other three fingers on the back** of the blade. Beginners usually “fan” them; some players “stack” the middle/ring fingers—both are fine.\n\n3. Keep space and softness\n   Leave space between palm and handle. Grip softly so the wrist is very mobile.\n\n4. Forehand feel\n   Most control comes from the thumb–index pinch. Keep the blade slightly closed for drives; open a touch for topspin.\n\n5. Backhand options\n   For traditional penhold, use the forehand side for many shots by rotating the wrist. For RPB (reverse penhold backhand), contact with the back side—keep those rear fingers relaxed to allow the flip.\n\n6. Quick checks\n   No squeezing; blade moves easily with wrist; contact points feel precise at the thumb/index.\n\n# Common mistakes to avoid\n\n* **Death grip** (too tight) → kills wrist speed and touch.\n* **Index finger too high** across the rubber → limits forehand.\n* **Thumb creeping up** onto the rubber → blocks backhand.\n* **Palming the blade** (covering rubber with the palm) → reduces spin and reach.\n\n# Fast reminders\n\n* Relax first, then add just enough firmness at contact.\n* Small pressure shifts (thumb ↔ index) fine-tune forehand/backhand angles.\n* Start with shakehand if you’re unsure; it’s the most versatile for beginners.\n\nIf you want, I can also generate a second image focused solely on **shakehand** or **penhold**, or make printable cue cards.\n",

    "reference_text": "This diagram shows Ray (optics). In optics, a ray is an idealized model of light, obtained by choosing a line that is perpendicular to the wave fronts of the actual light, and that points in the direction of energy flow. Rays are used to model the propagation of light through an optical system by dividing the real light field up into discrete rays that can be computationally propagated through the system by the techniques of ray tracing. All three rays should meet at the same point. The Principal Ray or Chief Ray in an optical system is the meridional ray that starts at the edge of the object and passes through the center of the aperture stop. This ray crosses the optical axis at the locations of the pupils. The Central Ray is perpendicular to infrared radiation. The Focal Ray is drawn from the tip of the object through (or towards) the focal point, reflecting off the mirror parallel to the principal axis.",

Most ocean carbon is stored as bicarbonate/carbonate, buffering the atmosphere.\n3. **Biological pump:** Phytoplankton photosynthesize; part of their organic matter and the **CaCO₃ shells** from calcifying organisms sink, carrying carbon to the **deep ocean**. Much is respired at depth (CO₂ stored for decades–centuries) and later **upwells** back to the surface and air.\n\n## 3) Route from plant carbon → **fossil fuels** (slow cycle)\n\nOnly a tiny fraction of plant carbon escapes decomposition and fire:\n\n1. **Rapid burial in anoxic settings:** In swamps, peatlands, deltas, or marine muds, dead plant/algal matter is buried faster than it decays. Low oxygen slows microbes.\n2. **Diagenesis & maturation (heat + pressure + time):**\n\n   * **Terrestrial plants → peat → lignite → coal.**\n   * **Marine algae/zooplankton → organic-rich muds → kerogen → oil & natural gas.**\n3. **Geologic storage:** These hydrocarbons remain trapped in rocks for millions of years unless exposed, uplifted, or extracted.\n\n## 4) Weathering, rocks, and volcanoes (slow geologic loop)\n\n1. **Silicate weathering (atmosphere → rivers → ocean):** CO₂ in rainwater forms weak acid that weathers rocks; dissolved bicarbonate flows to the ocean.\n2. **Carbonate formation:** Marine organisms and chemistry turn bicarbonate into **limestone/dolomite (CaCO₃/MgCO₃)** that gets buried as rock.\n3. **Subduction & degassing:** Tectonics carry carbonates and organic sediments into the mantle; **volcanoes** and metamorphism return CO₂ to the atmosphere.\n\n## 5) Human accelerators\n\n* **Fossil fuel extraction & combustion → atmosphere:** Moves carbon from the slow reservoir (coal/oil/gas) to the fast one as CO₂.\n* **Cement production:** Releases CO₂ when limestone is calcined.\n* **Deforestation & land-use change:** Reduces photosynthetic uptake and releases stored biomass/soil carbon.\n* **Methane leaks & agriculture:** Add CH₄, which later becomes CO₂.\n* **Permafrost thaw/peatland drainage:** Frees long-stored organic carbon as CO₂/CH₄.\n* **Ocean uptake & acidification:** Extra atmospheric CO₂ drives more dissolution, shifting seawater chemistry and affecting calcifiers.\n\n## 6) Direct answers to your two “where does plant carbon go?” questions\n\n* **Into the atmosphere:** through plant/animal **respiration**, **microbial decay** (CO₂/CH₄), **fires**, and **human burning** of biomass or extracted fossil fuels.\n* **Into fossil fuels:** when dead plant (or algal) material is **rapidly buried in oxygen-poor sediments**, then **cooked by heat and pressure** for **geologic timescales**, transforming into **coal (mainly land plants)** or **oil/gas (mainly marine algae/zooplankton)**.\n\nIf you’d like, I can tailor a simpler “student cheat-sheet” version or add typical timescales and example environments for each arrow.\n",
