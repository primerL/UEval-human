    "reference_text": "1. 1. Begin the dog cartoon outline by drawing his face. Outline the eyes using curved lines. Extend the side of one eye to form the top of the long snout or muzzle. 2. 2. At the end of the snout, draw a circle. This is the dog’s nose. Use curved lines to trace the side of the dog’s face and his forehead. Above the eyes, use curved lines to enclose the pointed eyebrows 3. 3. Draw the dog’s open, smiling mouth. Below the nose, draw a wide, curved “W” shaped line. Let it meet the nose on one side. On the other, extend the arm of the “W” all the way to the corner of the mouth. Below this, use curved lines to outline the lower jaw, the inside of the mouth, and the tongue. Contour the corner of the mouth with short lines. At the front of the snout, draw two small, triangular teeth. 4. 4. Use curved lines to enclose the rounded shapes of the dog’s ears. Then, use long curved lines to trace the top of the head, neck, and side of the body. 5. 5. Extend a long curved line below the lower jaw to form the chest. Then, use a pair of long curved lines to draw the leg. At the bottom, use overlapping curved lines to create the toes and enclose the paw. 6. 6. Contour the chest with a curved line and draw the remaining front leg. Again, use curved lines. Those at the toes should overlap. 7. 7. Draw the rear leg, bent into a sitting position, using curved lines. Again the toes should utilize overlapping curved lines. 8. 8. Draw the remaining leg of the sitting dog. Use curved lines for the back, the bent leg, and the round paw. Band the paw with short lines. 9. 9. Complete your dog cartoon outline by drawing his wagging tail. Extend two curved lines from the dog’s hip and allow them to meet at a sharp point. Beside the tail, sketch a hatch mark pattern using curved lines to simulate the motion of the tail. 10. Color your cartoon dog. We’ve shaded ours dark brown like a chocolate labrador dog.",

    "generated_text": "Here’s a simple, beginner-friendly way to draw a cute cartoon dog (front view, sitting). Keep your lines light until the end—then trace the final outline darker.\n\nYou’ll need: pencil, eraser, black pen/marker, and optional colored pencils/markers.\n\nStep-by-step (8 steps)\n\nHead & muzzle\nDraw a big circle for the head. Lightly add a short vertical guideline. At the bottom of the circle, sketch a small horizontal oval for the muzzle (it overlaps the circle).\n\nEars\nAdd two floppy, teardrop-like ears on the sides of the head. Their tips should hang lower than the midpoint of the head.\n\nNose & smile\nOn the muzzle, draw a small rounded triangle for the nose. From its sides, curve two short lines downward to suggest a smile. Add a wide “U” under the smile for the mouth/tongue.\n\nEyes & brows\nAbove the muzzle, draw two big ovals for eyes. Add tiny white circles for highlights and fill the pupils around them. Two small curved dashes above each eye make friendly brows.\n\nBody shape\nUnder the head, draw a wide “U” shape for the chest/body. Let the head overlap the body slightly (no neck needed).\n\nFront legs & paws\nFrom the body, add two long “U” shapes straight down for the front legs. At the bottom, draw 3 small bumps on each paw to suggest toes.\n\nBack leg & tail\nOn one side, add a “C” shaped curve for the back leg with a small oval paw peeking out. Sketch a short curved tail to one side.\n\nDetails, cleanup & style\nAdd a collar band and tiny tag under the head if you like. Erase extra construction lines. Trace your final outline with thicker, smooth lines. Optional spots/patches and a soft ground shadow under the paws.\n\nQuick coloring guide (optional)\n\nCoat: light brown or cream\n\nEars/patches: slightly darker brown\n\nNose: black; Tongue: pink\n\nCollar: any bright color (e.g., blue)\n\nLeave small white shines in the eyes\n\nProportion tip: Big head + small body + big eyes = instant cute.\nVariation: Try perky ears, a curlier tail, or different spot patterns.",

    "reference_text": "1. 1. Draw an oval or egg shape to create the first rib of the pumpkin. Then, enclose another curved shape alongside it to create a second rib. 2. 2. Continue using long curved lines to enclose rounded ribs until the pumpkin has a round, full shape. 3. 3. Draw the pumpkin's thick stem. Extend two curved lines from the top of the pumpkin. From each of these, draw a long curved line. The lines should be roughly parallel and \"S\" shaped. 4. 4. Use a curved line to enclose the end of the stem. Draw another curved line across it to give the tip of the stem an oval shape. Then, texture the stem with curved lines. Use additional short lines to begin enclosing the ribs visible behind the stem. 5. 5. Complete the pumpkin's ribs. Then, draw tendrils of vine terminating from the stem. Use long, curving, \"S\" shaped lines. 6. 6. Draw a leaf along the pumpkin vine. First, extend a curved line from the vine. This forms the leaf's stem and vein. Then, use a series of connected, curved lines to outline the body of the leaf. 7. 7. Continue to draw the body of the leaf on the opposite side of the vein. Then, draw secondary veins extending from the primary vein or midrib. 8. 8. Draw the remaining veins, and begin a second leaf. Again, use a curved line for the stem and a series of curved lines to sketch the outline of the leaf. 9. 9. Complete the leaf, erasing as necessary. Finish outlining the leaf, and draw the secondary veins. 10. Color your pumpkin. Traditionally, pumpkins are orange in color. They can also be yellow, brown, green, or white!",

Fill in the middle ribs\n   Add 2–3 more curved ribs between the outer ones, all meeting near the top and bottom to suggest depth.\n\n4. Shape the top and bottom\n   Flatten the bottom with a shallow curve so it can “sit.” At the top, tuck the ribs slightly inward to form a little dip.\n\n5. Draw the stem\n   From the top dip, sketch a short, slightly curved stem (think a bent cylinder). Add a notch or two where it meets the pumpkin.\n\n6. Optional leaf & vine\n   Add a simple leaf beside the stem and a loose curly vine for character.\n\n7. Clean lines\n   Erase the original oval and any overlaps you don’t need. Thicken the outer contour slightly to make the form pop.\n\n8. Shade & color\n   Color the pumpkin a warm orange. Deepen the creases between ribs with a darker orange/brown, keep the front planes lighter, color the stem green-brown, and add a soft shadow under the pumpkin.\n\nQuick tips\n\n* Keep rib curves widest at the middle and narrower near top/bottom.\n* If it looks too round, widen the oval; if too flat, make it taller.\n* Highlights along one side instantly make it look glossy.\n",

    "question": "How to hand-wash delicate clothing safely? Provide a visual guide and text the steps. ",
    "reference_text": "1. The tags on your clothes tell you the best ways to clean them. Read through the tag on each garment that you’re washing to see what fabric it’s made from and how to clean it properly. Keep similar fabrics together so you can wash them at the same time. Anything that can go in your machine or that has a “hand wash only” label is safe for hand-washing. If a tag says “dry clean only,” then avoid hand-washing that garment to avoid damaging it. As a quick way to check if your garments are safe to hand-wash, place a drop of water on the fabric and blot it up with a paper towel. If the color runs or bleeds, then take it to the dry cleaners. 2. Washing similar garments in the same load prevents colors from running. Sort your laundry so all the light fabrics are separated from the dark ones. Since darker colors could potentially discolor the water, wash the lightest colored clothes first and save the darker ones for last. If you have a new item of clothing that is dyed or colored, wash it separately in a different tub or basin so the color does not get on other clothing. 3. Using a stain remover beforehand makes it easier to wash out. Apply the stain remover directly over the mark on your clothes. Gently dab the stain with your fingers or brush it lightly with a new toothbrush to work the cleaner deeper into the fabric. Let the stain remover sit for about 10–15 minutes before you wash your garment. Test the stain remover in a small inconspicuous spot on your clothes before applying it directly to the stain. 4. A mild detergent meant for delicates cleans clothes more gently. Use your bathtub, sink, or large bowl depending on how many clothes you need to wash. Stick with cool or lukewarm water when you wash your clothes to prevent colors from running. Mix about 1 1 ⁄ 2 fluid ounces (44 ml) of detergent into the water until it’s completely dissolved and forms suds. [5] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Wool and fine knits: Use cold water and wool detergent to keep the fabric soft. Silk or lace: Try a no-rinse detergent to limit how much water comes in contact with the fabric. Alternatively, use mild liquid dish soap if you’re in a pinch. 5. Gently stirring the water is less damaging to clothes than scrubbing. Drop your first load of clothes into the water so they’re submerged. Then, use your hands to gently move the clothes around to wash out the dirt between the fibers. Keep agitating the water for about 2–3 minutes, or until the clothes look clean. Sweaters: Turn sweaters inside-out before washing them to clean them better. Avoid scrubbing, twisting, or rubbing your clothes together when you hand-wash them since you could stretch and damage the fabric. 6. Soaking helps lift dirt and stains deep in the fabric. Leave your clothes submerged for at least 10 minutes so the detergent has time to work through the fabric. If your clothes are really dirty or have stubborn stains, leave them in the water for up to 30 minutes so it’s even more effective. It’s normal for the water to darken as dirt lifts out of the fabric. If the water ever looks really cloudy or dirty, empty it out and refill your container. 7. A thorough rinse removes all the detergent and leftover dirt. Either empty out your container and refill it with clean water, or hold your garments underneath a running faucet. Gently squeeze your clothes as you rinse them until you don’t see any more suds coming out. Alternatively, fill a second container with clean water and transfer your clothes over to rinse them. 8. Gently squeezing your clothes prevents them from stretching. Hold your garments above the water when you squeeze them so you don’t drip. then, lay your garment flat on a towel and slowly roll the towel up to squeeze out even more water. Avoid twisting or wringing out your clothes too forcefully since you’ll stretch or damage the fabric fibers. 9. Drying your clothes flat helps them preserve their shape. While T-shirts and pants are safe to hang dry, delicate fabrics could stretch or distort. When you’re washing sweaters, silks, bras, or lingerie, spread the garments flat so they’re shaped correctly. Keep them in a well-ventilated spot and flip your clothes over after 1–2 hours so the other side can dry. Turn a fan on in the same room as your clothes to help them dry faster. Avoid putting your clothes in the dryer unless the care tag says it’s safe. Otherwise, your clothes may get damaged or shrink.",

    "reference_text": "1. Wash your hands before cleaning your glasses. Wash up for 20 seconds with lotion-free soap and warm water. You’ll need to make sure your hands are free of dirt, grease, and grime before cleaning your glasses. 2. Rinse your glasses with warm water. Run a gentle stream of tap water over your glasses. Rotate them to wet both sides of each lens, the frame, and earpieces. Hot water is bad for lenses, protective coatings, and the frame, so be sure to use warm water. 3. Use your fingertips to carefully lather them with dish soap. Add a small drop of lotion-free dish soap to each lens. Make gentle circular motions with your fingertips to lather the soap over both sides of your lenses, around the frame, and down each earpiece. 4. Clean the nose pads with a cotton swab or soft toothbrush. Use gentle pressure as you scrub the nose pads and the crevices between them and the frame. If you’re using a toothbrush, make sure it’s soft-bristled. Avoid grazing the lenses with the toothbrush, even if it’s soft-bristled. If there’s buildup between the lenses and the frame, use a cotton swab to loosen it. 5. Wash away soap residue. Hold the glasses under running water again to rinse away soap suds. Make sure you’ve washed away all traces of soap, as any remaining residue will cause smudges. 6. Shake off excess water and make sure your lenses are clean. Turn off the water, then give your glasses a careful shake. Check the lenses to make sure they’re clear, and wash them again if you see any smudges. 7. Dry your glasses with a microfiber cloth. Fold a clean microfiber cloth over both sides of a lens. Make soft circular motions with your fingertips to dry it, then repeat on the other lens. Wipe the nose pads, then use the cloth to dry and polish the frame and earpieces. [6] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source 8. Spray your glasses liberally with eyeglass cleaner. Spray cleaners for eyewear are available at pharmacies and eyewear retailers. If you can’t get to a sink and dish soap, spray your glasses with lots of cleaner to flush away dirt and debris. Some eyewear manufacturers and optometrists also offer free samples of spray cleaner. If you have anti-reflective (AR) glasses, make sure the cleaner you use is labelled safe for the AR coating. 9. Wipe away the cleaner with a microfiber cloth. After spraying your glasses, carefully wipe off excess cleaner. Fold the cloth over both sides of each lens, and make gentle circular motions with your fingertips to absorb the cleaner. Then use the cloth to dry the frame and earpieces. 10. Touch up your lenses with disposable eyeglass wet wipes. You can also clean your glasses with wet wipes when you’re on the go. Gently blow on them to remove dust and dirt, then gently rub them with a wet wipe using soft, circular motions. After cleaning them, dry them with a microfiber cloth. Only use wet wipes labelled for cleaning eyewear. If you have AR glasses, make sure your wipes are labelled safe for the AR coating. 11. Clean your glasses every morning and as needed. Make cleaning your glasses part of your morning routine. Check them regularly throughout the day, and touch them up as needed. Keeping your glasses clean and smudge-free will help prevent scratches. 12. Store your glasses in a hard case when you’re not wearing them. Don’t just throw your glasses in your purse or bag, and avoid placing the lenses on hard surfaces. When they’re not in use, keep them in a hard-shell case. The case should fit your glasses; if it’s too big, they might roll around and get damaged. [11] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source 13. Wash your microfiber cloths frequently. Microfiber cloths collect grease and dirt, so you should wash yours after 2 or 3 uses. Some cloths are machine washable, so check the care instructions and launder them as directed. [12] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source If your cloth isn’t machine washable, or if you’re not sure, hand wash it with dish soap, wring it out, then let it air dry. 14. Don’t wipe your glasses with your shirt, tissue, or a paper towel. Shirts, tissues, and paper towels contain fine debris that could scratch your glasses. Additionally, never wipe your glasses when they’re dry, or you’ll risk damaging them. Exhaling on your glasses and wiping them with your shirt might be convenient, but that’s a quick way to scratch up your lenses. Need help keeping your glasses clean?

    "reference_text": "1. Use a mnemonic to remember how to tie the knot. Think of the loop as a \"rabbit's hole\" and the string end coming off the loop as a \"tree\". Imagine the other loose end of the string, which you're holding in your right hand, is the \"rabbit\". The rabbit comes up the hole, runs around the tree, and goes back down the hole. Another way to remember how to make this knot is with a rhyme: \"Lay the bight to make a hole Then under the back and around the pole Over the top and through the eye Clinch it tight and let it lie\" 2. Hold one end of the rope in your left hand. This will be your ‘standing end’ or the end that does not move (consider this end the ‘hole’ and the ‘tree’.) Hold the other end in your right hand (this is the free end--the end of the rope that will be used to form the knot, or the ‘rabbit.’)Make a small loop with the end of the string in your left hand. This loop is the ‘hole’ the rabbit comes out of. [4] X Expert Source Jordan Frazier Knot Tying Expert Expert Interview These instructions assume you start with an \"underhand\" loop, so that the free end of the string is under the intersection formed by the loop. 3. Draw the end of the string in your right hand (the rabbit) through the loop made by your left hand (the hole. ) The end should be coming towards you as it goes through the loop. Think of this as the rabbit coming out of its hole. [7] X Expert Source Jordan Frazier Knot Tying Expert Expert Interview 4. Bring the ‘rabbit’ end around (behind) the string. This string is the part pointing upwards from the loop (the ‘tree’.) Pull the ‘rabbit’ back through the loop and down into the ‘hole’. This time the end is going away from you. [9] X Expert Source Jordan Frazier Knot Tying Expert Expert Interview 5. Take the top loose string in your left hand. Hold the other end in your right hand and pull the ends in opposite directions to tighten the knot. [10] X Expert Source Jordan Frazier Knot Tying Expert Expert Interview",

Adjust until the knot is compact and tidy.\n\n6. **Safety checks (do these every time):**\n\n* There’s a **fixed loop** that does not slip when you pull the standing part.\n* A single **collar** (turn) wraps cleanly around the standing part.\n* Leave a **tail ≥ 10–15 cm (4–6 in)**.\n\n7. **Make it more secure (recommended):**\n\n* Tie a **double overhand stopper** with the tail snug against the bowline, **or**\n* Use a **Yosemite finish** (run the tail up behind the loop and back down beside the standing part, then dress snug). Either helps prevent loosening from repeated loading/unloading.\n\n**When to use (and not):**\n\n* Great for forming a non-slipping loop for general utility, boating, and rescue rigging by trained users.\n* **Avoid for life-safety or climbing unless you’re trained** and use an appropriate backup/variation; bowlines can loosen under cyclic load or if shaken when slack.\n\n**Quick memory aid:** *“Rabbit comes out of the hole, goes around the tree, and back into the hole.”*\n\n**To untie:** Push the collar to break the set, then pull the working end—bowlines are easy to release even after heavy load.\n",

The green copper skin you see outside is thin and non-structural; it hangs like a curtain on the frame.\n • Platforms & stairs anchored to the frame: Metal stairways and viewing platforms are bolted to the central support and armature, so a visitor’s weight goes into the steel/iron skeleton, not the copper shell.\n • Pedestal transfers the loads: All those forces flow down into a massive granite/concrete pedestal and then into the foundation, so visitor loads are easily supported.\n • Engineered for movement & safety: The structure can flex slightly in wind, and access is controlled with rails, capacity limits, and modern safety upgrades—making the crown room and decks safe for brief occupancy.\n • Where you can’t stand: The torch is not open to the public; visitors stand on engineered platforms (pedestal decks and the crown), not on the statue’s skin.",

    "question": "How to Do a Cartwheel? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Picture an imaginary line extending straight in front of you. Use this line as a guide while you perform your cartwheel. You can even use painter’s tape to create a real line across a carpet or a mat . Make this line several feet long. Try to stay on the line, as if the line is a balance beam. As you focus on the line, be sure to keep your form in mind, too. Make sure the area around your line is free and clear. Avoid practicing cartwheels near walls or pieces of furniture that you might run into. Injuries occur when you bump into something hard. Stretch your arms and legs before practicing a cartwheel. This helps to stretch out your muscles and reduces the risk of injury. 2. Lunge forward with your lead leg and raise your arms. Slightly bend your front leg at the knee and keep your back leg straight. Keep both feet pointing forward parallel to your imaginary line. Hold your arms straight up by your ears. A common mistake is to start a cartwheel while facing sideways. Make sure you’re facing forwards as you prepare and start for your cartwheel. That is the correct way. Either leg can be your lead leg. Sometimes, however, it's more comfortable to use one leg instead of the other—you can try to figure out which one by doing a series of handstands, some starting with your right leg in front, others with your left. Whichever leading leg feels more natural is the one you should use for your cartwheel.You can determine your leading by watching which leg in splits feels more comfortable. 3. Lower your arms towards the ground while raising your back leg. Keep your arms straight by your ears as you lower them down to bring your head and torso down as well. Only lower your arms about halfway to the ground. Bring your back leg up while keeping it straight so your body forms a “T” shape. This step requires balance. You may need to drop your leg several times before you find a balanced position you can hold. Don’t worry if you’re having trouble balancing. Once you get the hang of the cartwheel, you won’t have to hold this position for very long since it will all become one continuous and natural movement. 4. Place your hands on the mat as you turn your body sideways. Put down the arm on the same side of your body as your lead leg first. Then put your other arm down so they're spread about shoulder width apart, similar to the way they would be positioned for a handstand. Place both hands along the imaginary line. Think \"hand hand feet\" to help you process the cartwheel. For example, if you lunged with your right leg, place your right hand down first, then your left hand. Keep the fingers of each hand pointing away from your head. 5. Push off on your front leg, then bring your legs up in a V shape. Straighten your front leg as you push so your legs end up in the air, pointing straight upwards. Balance your weight on your arms with your hands shoulder-width apart on either side of your head. Keep your head and torso upside down and positioned directly over your arms. Use your shoulders and core for support. You won’t hold this position for long. Cartwheels should be performed in one fluid motion. Make sure to keep your legs straight the whole time. If you are a beginner, then you may want to practice more. 6. Lower your lead leg as you lift the first hand you put down off the mat. To complete the cartwheel, put your leading leg down first along your imaginary line. The first hand you placed on the mat will lift up naturally as your foot comes down. Bring your arm up by your ear to finish the cartwheel. Your weight should start to shift onto your legs. Keep your head and torso roughly parallel to the mat. 7. Bring your other leg down while lifting your other hand off the mat. Your other leg will follow the first as it comes down. Make sure to place your back foot behind your leading foot along the same imaginary line so both feet point back in the direction you came from. Your second hand will lift naturally off the mat, following the first hand. At this point, both your head and torso should be right side up, centered over your legs. A common mistake while cartwheeling is leaving your hands on the ground for too long. Make sure that your arms stay straight and by your ears as your chest and head come up at the end of the cartwheel. 8. Land in a lunge facing in the opposite direction. Position yourself so your original back leg is in front and slightly bent, while your original leading leg is behind you and straight, just like a lunge. Keep both feet pointing in the direction you came from. Make sure your arms are straight and pointing upwards, next to your ears. Position your torso in the same direction your feet are pointing.",

It’s a two-part block:\n\n1. a **gated cross-attention (XATTN)** sublayer, and\n2. a **gated feed-forward (“DENSE”/MLP)** sublayer, each wrapped with pre-LayerNorm and residual connections.\n\n---\n\n## Inputs\n\n* **Text hidden states** (H \\in \\mathbb{R^{T\\times d}}): current LM token embeddings.\n* **Visual latents** (Z \\in \\mathbb{R^{M\\times d_v}}): a fixed set of tokens produced by the Perceiver Resampler from one or more images/video frames.\n* (Learned) **gating projections** that turn each token’s state into an element-wise gate.\n\n---\n\n## Step-by-step flow\n\n### 1) Gated Cross-Attention (XATTN)\n\n* **Pre-norm:** (\\tilde H = \\mathrm{LN}(H)).\n* **Cross-attention:** queries (Q) come from (\\tilde H); keys/values (K,V) come from (Z).\n  [\n  A=\\mathrm{MHA}(\\tilde H W_Q,\\; ZW_K,\\; ZW_V)\n    ]\n* **Gate the visual update:** compute a token-wise, channel-wise gate\n  [\n  g_x=\\sigma(\\tilde H W_{gx}+b_{gx})\\in\\mathbb{R^{T\\times d}},\n    ]\n  then modulate the cross-attn output and add residually: [\n  H^{(1)}=H + g_x \\odot A.\n    ]\n  The gate lets the layer learn **how much** each token should trust vision, often starting near “closed” so initial behavior matches the base LM.\n\n### 2) Gated DENSE (position-wise MLP)\n\n* **Pre-norm:** (\\hat H=\\mathrm{LN}(H^{(1)})).\n* **MLP/Dense:** (F=\\phi(\\hat H W_1 + b_1) W_2 + b_2) (with a standard nonlinearity (\\phi), e.g., GELU).\n* **Gate the MLP update:**\n  [\n  g_d=\\sigma(\\hat H W_{gd}+b_{gd}),\\qquad\n  H_{\\text{out}}=H^{(1)} + g_d \\odot F.\n    ]\n\n---\n\n## Why the gating?\n\n* **Stability with frozen backbones:** The LM (and typically the vision encoder) can remain frozen; new parameters are in the XATTN/DENSE paths and their gates. Gating prevents overwhelming the LM with visual signals early in training and enables smooth **modality balancing**.\n* **Token-specific control:** Gates are computed **per token** and **per channel**, so some words (e.g., nouns near image mentions) can open the visual pathway more than others.\n* **Regularization by design:** With gates near zero, the block reduces to an identity map, which curbs overfitting and preserves strong language priors.\n\n---\n\n## Placement in Flamingo\n\nThese Gated XATTN-DENSE blocks are **interleaved at several points** inside the LM stack. During inference on interleaved image–text streams, each text segment can query the relevant **cached** visual latents via the XATTN, while standard self-attention continues to handle language context.\n\n---\n\n## Summary of components\n\n* **LayerNorm (pre-norm)** before each sublayer\n* **Multi-Head Cross-Attention** (Q from text, K/V from visual latents)\n* **Learned sigmoid gates** (g_x, g_d) (element-wise modulation)\n* **Position-wise MLP (“DENSE”)**\n* **Residual connections** after both sublayers\n\nIf you’d like, I can annotate the diagram with your preferred symbols (e.g., different gate shapes, head counts, or exact tensor sizes) and export it as SVG or PDF.\n",
