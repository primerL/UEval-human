    "reference_text": "1. 1. Begin the dog cartoon outline by drawing his face. Outline the eyes using curved lines. Extend the side of one eye to form the top of the long snout or muzzle. 2. 2. At the end of the snout, draw a circle. This is the dog’s nose. Use curved lines to trace the side of the dog’s face and his forehead. Above the eyes, use curved lines to enclose the pointed eyebrows 3. 3. Draw the dog’s open, smiling mouth. Below the nose, draw a wide, curved “W” shaped line. Let it meet the nose on one side. On the other, extend the arm of the “W” all the way to the corner of the mouth. Below this, use curved lines to outline the lower jaw, the inside of the mouth, and the tongue. Contour the corner of the mouth with short lines. At the front of the snout, draw two small, triangular teeth. 4. 4. Use curved lines to enclose the rounded shapes of the dog’s ears. Then, use long curved lines to trace the top of the head, neck, and side of the body. 5. 5. Extend a long curved line below the lower jaw to form the chest. Then, use a pair of long curved lines to draw the leg. At the bottom, use overlapping curved lines to create the toes and enclose the paw. 6. 6. Contour the chest with a curved line and draw the remaining front leg. Again, use curved lines. Those at the toes should overlap. 7. 7. Draw the rear leg, bent into a sitting position, using curved lines. Again the toes should utilize overlapping curved lines. 8. 8. Draw the remaining leg of the sitting dog. Use curved lines for the back, the bent leg, and the round paw. Band the paw with short lines. 9. 9. Complete your dog cartoon outline by drawing his wagging tail. Extend two curved lines from the dog’s hip and allow them to meet at a sharp point. Beside the tail, sketch a hatch mark pattern using curved lines to simulate the motion of the tail. 10. Color your cartoon dog. We’ve shaded ours dark brown like a chocolate labrador dog.",

Keep your lines light until the end—then trace the final outline darker.\n\nYou’ll need: pencil, eraser, black pen/marker, and optional colored pencils/markers.\n\nStep-by-step (8 steps)\n\nHead & muzzle\nDraw a big circle for the head. Lightly add a short vertical guideline. At the bottom of the circle, sketch a small horizontal oval for the muzzle (it overlaps the circle).\n\nEars\nAdd two floppy, teardrop-like ears on the sides of the head. Their tips should hang lower than the midpoint of the head.\n\nNose & smile\nOn the muzzle, draw a small rounded triangle for the nose. From its sides, curve two short lines downward to suggest a smile. Add a wide “U” under the smile for the mouth/tongue.\n\nEyes & brows\nAbove the muzzle, draw two big ovals for eyes. Add tiny white circles for highlights and fill the pupils around them. Two small curved dashes above each eye make friendly brows.\n\nBody shape\nUnder the head, draw a wide “U” shape for the chest/body. Let the head overlap the body slightly (no neck needed).\n\nFront legs & paws\nFrom the body, add two long “U” shapes straight down for the front legs. At the bottom, draw 3 small bumps on each paw to suggest toes.\n\nBack leg & tail\nOn one side, add a “C” shaped curve for the back leg with a small oval paw peeking out. Sketch a short curved tail to one side.\n\nDetails, cleanup & style\nAdd a collar band and tiny tag under the head if you like. Erase extra construction lines. Trace your final outline with thicker, smooth lines. Optional spots/patches and a soft ground shadow under the paws.\n\nQuick coloring guide (optional)\n\nCoat: light brown or cream\n\nEars/patches: slightly darker brown\n\nNose: black; Tongue: pink\n\nCollar: any bright color (e.g., blue)\n\nLeave small white shines in the eyes\n\nProportion tip: Big head + small body + big eyes = instant cute.\nVariation: Try perky ears, a curlier tail, or different spot patterns.",

Continue using long curved lines to enclose rounded ribs until the pumpkin has a round, full shape. 3. 3. Draw the pumpkin's thick stem. Extend two curved lines from the top of the pumpkin. From each of these, draw a long curved line. The lines should be roughly parallel and \"S\" shaped. 4. 4. Use a curved line to enclose the end of the stem. Draw another curved line across it to give the tip of the stem an oval shape. Then, texture the stem with curved lines. Use additional short lines to begin enclosing the ribs visible behind the stem. 5. 5. Complete the pumpkin's ribs. Then, draw tendrils of vine terminating from the stem. Use long, curving, \"S\" shaped lines. 6. 6. Draw a leaf along the pumpkin vine. First, extend a curved line from the vine. This forms the leaf's stem and vein. Then, use a series of connected, curved lines to outline the body of the leaf. 7. 7. Continue to draw the body of the leaf on the opposite side of the vein. Then, draw secondary veins extending from the primary vein or midrib. 8. 8. Draw the remaining veins, and begin a second leaf. Again, use a curved line for the stem and a series of curved lines to sketch the outline of the leaf. 9. 9. Complete the leaf, erasing as necessary. Finish outlining the leaf, and draw the secondary veins. 10. Color your pumpkin. Traditionally, pumpkins are orange in color. They can also be yellow, brown, green, or white!",

Draw the stem\n   From the top dip, sketch a short, slightly curved stem (think a bent cylinder). Add a notch or two where it meets the pumpkin.\n\n6. Optional leaf & vine\n   Add a simple leaf beside the stem and a loose curly vine for character.\n\n7. Clean lines\n   Erase the original oval and any overlaps you don’t need. Thicken the outer contour slightly to make the form pop.\n\n8. Shade & color\n   Color the pumpkin a warm orange. Deepen the creases between ribs with a darker orange/brown, keep the front planes lighter, color the stem green-brown, and add a soft shadow under the pumpkin.\n\nQuick tips\n\n* Keep rib curves widest at the middle and narrower near top/bottom.\n* If it looks too round, widen the oval; if too flat, make it taller.\n* Highlights along one side instantly make it look glossy.\n",

    "question": "How to hand-wash delicate clothing safely? Provide a visual guide and text the steps. ",
    "reference_text": "1. The tags on your clothes tell you the best ways to clean them. Read through the tag on each garment that you’re washing to see what fabric it’s made from and how to clean it properly. Keep similar fabrics together so you can wash them at the same time. Anything that can go in your machine or that has a “hand wash only” label is safe for hand-washing. If a tag says “dry clean only,” then avoid hand-washing that garment to avoid damaging it. As a quick way to check if your garments are safe to hand-wash, place a drop of water on the fabric and blot it up with a paper towel. If the color runs or bleeds, then take it to the dry cleaners. 2. Washing similar garments in the same load prevents colors from running. Sort your laundry so all the light fabrics are separated from the dark ones. Since darker colors could potentially discolor the water, wash the lightest colored clothes first and save the darker ones for last. If you have a new item of clothing that is dyed or colored, wash it separately in a different tub or basin so the color does not get on other clothing. 3. Using a stain remover beforehand makes it easier to wash out. Apply the stain remover directly over the mark on your clothes. Gently dab the stain with your fingers or brush it lightly with a new toothbrush to work the cleaner deeper into the fabric. Let the stain remover sit for about 10–15 minutes before you wash your garment. Test the stain remover in a small inconspicuous spot on your clothes before applying it directly to the stain. 4. A mild detergent meant for delicates cleans clothes more gently. Use your bathtub, sink, or large bowl depending on how many clothes you need to wash. Stick with cool or lukewarm water when you wash your clothes to prevent colors from running. Mix about 1 1 ⁄ 2 fluid ounces (44 ml) of detergent into the water until it’s completely dissolved and forms suds. [5] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Wool and fine knits: Use cold water and wool detergent to keep the fabric soft. Silk or lace: Try a no-rinse detergent to limit how much water comes in contact with the fabric. Alternatively, use mild liquid dish soap if you’re in a pinch. 5. Gently stirring the water is less damaging to clothes than scrubbing. Drop your first load of clothes into the water so they’re submerged. Then, use your hands to gently move the clothes around to wash out the dirt between the fibers. Keep agitating the water for about 2–3 minutes, or until the clothes look clean. Sweaters: Turn sweaters inside-out before washing them to clean them better. Avoid scrubbing, twisting, or rubbing your clothes together when you hand-wash them since you could stretch and damage the fabric. 6. Soaking helps lift dirt and stains deep in the fabric. Leave your clothes submerged for at least 10 minutes so the detergent has time to work through the fabric. If your clothes are really dirty or have stubborn stains, leave them in the water for up to 30 minutes so it’s even more effective. It’s normal for the water to darken as dirt lifts out of the fabric. If the water ever looks really cloudy or dirty, empty it out and refill your container. 7. A thorough rinse removes all the detergent and leftover dirt. Either empty out your container and refill it with clean water, or hold your garments underneath a running faucet. Gently squeeze your clothes as you rinse them until you don’t see any more suds coming out. Alternatively, fill a second container with clean water and transfer your clothes over to rinse them. 8. Gently squeezing your clothes prevents them from stretching. Hold your garments above the water when you squeeze them so you don’t drip. then, lay your garment flat on a towel and slowly roll the towel up to squeeze out even more water. Avoid twisting or wringing out your clothes too forcefully since you’ll stretch or damage the fabric fibers. 9. Drying your clothes flat helps them preserve their shape. While T-shirts and pants are safe to hang dry, delicate fabrics could stretch or distort. When you’re washing sweaters, silks, bras, or lingerie, spread the garments flat so they’re shaped correctly. Keep them in a well-ventilated spot and flip your clothes over after 1–2 hours so the other side can dry. Turn a fan on in the same room as your clothes to help them dry faster. Avoid putting your clothes in the dryer unless the care tag says it’s safe. Otherwise, your clothes may get damaged or shrink.",

    "reference_text": "1. Wash your hands before cleaning your glasses. Wash up for 20 seconds with lotion-free soap and warm water. You’ll need to make sure your hands are free of dirt, grease, and grime before cleaning your glasses. 2. Rinse your glasses with warm water. Run a gentle stream of tap water over your glasses. Rotate them to wet both sides of each lens, the frame, and earpieces. Hot water is bad for lenses, protective coatings, and the frame, so be sure to use warm water. 3. Use your fingertips to carefully lather them with dish soap. Add a small drop of lotion-free dish soap to each lens. Make gentle circular motions with your fingertips to lather the soap over both sides of your lenses, around the frame, and down each earpiece. 4. Clean the nose pads with a cotton swab or soft toothbrush. Use gentle pressure as you scrub the nose pads and the crevices between them and the frame. If you’re using a toothbrush, make sure it’s soft-bristled. Avoid grazing the lenses with the toothbrush, even if it’s soft-bristled. If there’s buildup between the lenses and the frame, use a cotton swab to loosen it. 5. Wash away soap residue. Hold the glasses under running water again to rinse away soap suds. Make sure you’ve washed away all traces of soap, as any remaining residue will cause smudges. 6. Shake off excess water and make sure your lenses are clean. Turn off the water, then give your glasses a careful shake. Check the lenses to make sure they’re clear, and wash them again if you see any smudges. 7. Dry your glasses with a microfiber cloth. Fold a clean microfiber cloth over both sides of a lens. Make soft circular motions with your fingertips to dry it, then repeat on the other lens. Wipe the nose pads, then use the cloth to dry and polish the frame and earpieces. [6] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source 8. Spray your glasses liberally with eyeglass cleaner. Spray cleaners for eyewear are available at pharmacies and eyewear retailers. If you can’t get to a sink and dish soap, spray your glasses with lots of cleaner to flush away dirt and debris. Some eyewear manufacturers and optometrists also offer free samples of spray cleaner. If you have anti-reflective (AR) glasses, make sure the cleaner you use is labelled safe for the AR coating. 9. Wipe away the cleaner with a microfiber cloth. After spraying your glasses, carefully wipe off excess cleaner. Fold the cloth over both sides of each lens, and make gentle circular motions with your fingertips to absorb the cleaner. Then use the cloth to dry the frame and earpieces. 10. Touch up your lenses with disposable eyeglass wet wipes. You can also clean your glasses with wet wipes when you’re on the go. Gently blow on them to remove dust and dirt, then gently rub them with a wet wipe using soft, circular motions. After cleaning them, dry them with a microfiber cloth. Only use wet wipes labelled for cleaning eyewear. If you have AR glasses, make sure your wipes are labelled safe for the AR coating. 11. Clean your glasses every morning and as needed. Make cleaning your glasses part of your morning routine. Check them regularly throughout the day, and touch them up as needed. Keeping your glasses clean and smudge-free will help prevent scratches. 12. Store your glasses in a hard case when you’re not wearing them. Don’t just throw your glasses in your purse or bag, and avoid placing the lenses on hard surfaces. When they’re not in use, keep them in a hard-shell case. The case should fit your glasses; if it’s too big, they might roll around and get damaged. [11] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source 13. Wash your microfiber cloths frequently. Microfiber cloths collect grease and dirt, so you should wash yours after 2 or 3 uses. Some cloths are machine washable, so check the care instructions and launder them as directed. [12] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source If your cloth isn’t machine washable, or if you’re not sure, hand wash it with dish soap, wring it out, then let it air dry. 14. Don’t wipe your glasses with your shirt, tissue, or a paper towel. Shirts, tissues, and paper towels contain fine debris that could scratch your glasses. Additionally, never wipe your glasses when they’re dry, or you’ll risk damaging them. Exhaling on your glasses and wiping them with your shirt might be convenient, but that’s a quick way to scratch up your lenses. Need help keeping your glasses clean?

Imagine the other loose end of the string, which you're holding in your right hand, is the \"rabbit\". The rabbit comes up the hole, runs around the tree, and goes back down the hole. Another way to remember how to make this knot is with a rhyme: \"Lay the bight to make a hole Then under the back and around the pole Over the top and through the eye Clinch it tight and let it lie\" 2. Hold one end of the rope in your left hand. This will be your ‘standing end’ or the end that does not move (consider this end the ‘hole’ and the ‘tree’.) Hold the other end in your right hand (this is the free end--the end of the rope that will be used to form the knot, or the ‘rabbit.’)Make a small loop with the end of the string in your left hand. This loop is the ‘hole’ the rabbit comes out of. [4] X Expert Source Jordan Frazier Knot Tying Expert Expert Interview These instructions assume you start with an \"underhand\" loop, so that the free end of the string is under the intersection formed by the loop. 3. Draw the end of the string in your right hand (the rabbit) through the loop made by your left hand (the hole. ) The end should be coming towards you as it goes through the loop. Think of this as the rabbit coming out of its hole. [7] X Expert Source Jordan Frazier Knot Tying Expert Expert Interview 4. Bring the ‘rabbit’ end around (behind) the string.

    "generated_text": "Text (explanation):\n\nSingapore’s Helix Bridge looks like DNA because its main structure is literally two spiraling steel “ladders” that wrap around the walkway like a double helix. Short cross-members link the pair of spirals at regular intervals—just like DNA’s “base pairs”—and lighting emphasizes the twist so the pattern reads clearly, especially at night.\n\nIt can still carry crowds safely because that DNA form isn’t just decoration; it’s a working spatial truss. Here’s how it holds up the deck:\n\n* Two opposite helices share the load. One spiral primarily takes compression in some segments while the other takes tension; together they brace each other against buckling and twisting.\n* Radial struts connect the deck to the helices, so the walkway’s weight (and people on it) is transferred into the surrounding tube network rather than a single beam.\n* The helical tubes form closed, triangulated paths for forces, which is very efficient. Loads flow through the tubes to a series of piers in the bay, so the bridge is supported in stages rather than by one long, bending span.\n* Stainless-steel tubes provide high strength relative to weight and resist corrosion in the marine environment, keeping the structure stiff and durable.\n* The geometry also resists side winds and footfall vibrations, and the deck has full-height guardrails and non-slip surfacing for safety.\n\nIn short: the bridge reads as DNA because its load-bearing skeleton is a pair of intertwined steel helices with “rungs”—the same elements that make it strong enough for pedestrians.\n\n(Generated photo provided above.)\n",

Choose the right heels\n\n* Pick a stable pair: block heel or wedge, 2–3 in (5–7.5 cm), secure ankle strap, good fit.\n* Add non-slip sole grips if the bottoms are slick.\n\n2. Prep & warm up (1–2 min)\n\n* Ankle circles (both directions), calf raises, gentle hamstring/calf stretch.\n* Check straps/buckles are snug.\n\n3. Posture setup\n\n* Stand tall: ears over shoulders, shoulders over hips, ribs stacked, neutral pelvis.\n* Engage your core lightly; look where you’re going (not at your feet).\n\n4. Start with short, quick steps\n\n* Keep strides small to stay balanced.\n* Aim for a light, quick cadence rather than long reaches.\n\n5. Soft forefoot landing\n\n* Touch down gently near the ball of the foot, then roll through—avoid stabbing the heel first.\n* Keep toes pointing forward; don’t let ankles collapse inward.\n\n6. Use compact arm swing\n\n* Elbows ~90°, swing close to the body to counterbalance without twisting your torso.\n\n7. Pick safe surfaces\n\n* Prefer smooth, dry, even ground.\n* Avoid grates, cobblestones, grass, wet tile, and steep slopes.\n* If you must cross hazards, slow to a walk.\n\n8. Braking & turning\n\n* To slow: shorten steps, keep torso tall, don’t lean back.\n* For turns: take several tiny steps (no sharp pivots on a planted heel).\n\n9. Emergency stop & recovery\n\n* If you wobble: plant both feet shoulder-width, knees soft, lower your heels toward flat, then reset.\n* If a heel catches: stop, step back out, don’t yank forward.\n\n10. Cool down & care\n\n* Walk it off for 30–60 seconds, stretch calves/arches.\n* Inspect tips/heel caps; swap to flats if feet feel fatigued.\n\n### Practice Drills (build skill before full running)\n\n* March in place in heels (30–60s).\n* Walk–jog intervals: 10–20m jog, 20–30m walk; repeat 4–6x.\n* Figure-8 weaving around two cones/chairs to train controlled turns.\n\n### Safety Notes\n\n* Running in heels increases risk of ankle/knee injury—only do brief sprints when necessary.\n* Never run in very high, narrow stilettos or loose shoes.\n* Carry foldable flats as a backup.\n\nIf you’d like, I can generate alternate visuals (e.g., a printable poster or a horizontal storyboard) or tailor the steps to your specific heel height.\n",

You don't want to fall too far should you lose your balance . 2. Stand straight, with your tailbone tucked in. Engage your core by pulling in your upper ribs and belly. Make sure that the balls of your feet are solidly planted on the edge of the step. Your heels should be over the edge. If you feel unstable, or like you're losing your balance, practice this method with a wall or railing near by. Place your hands on the wall or the railing. 3. Lift your heels until you're standing on your tippy toes. Distribute most of your weight onto the balls of your feet, and keep your legs straight. 4. Stay on your tippy toes for two seconds. Then, begin to lower your heels, and move your weight away from the balls of your feet. Lower your heels until they're below the step, or platform. You should be feeling your calf muscles stretch on the downward movement. Repeat this sequence until you feel tired.",

    "question": "How to Catch a Baseball? Show visual steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Get the right glove. Your glove becomes an extension of your hand when catching a baseball. It must fit your hand properly to work efficiently. As a general rule of thumb, players under the age of 12 will use a glove in the 10–11 inch (25.4–27.9 cm) range. Older players will use something between 11 and 13 inch glove. Before playing regularly with your glove, it’s important to beak in your glove. One of the best ways to break in your glove is by practicing your catch. [1] X Expert Source Isaac Hess Baseball Coach & Instructor Expert Interview 2. Position your body. Catching a baseball relies heavily on your stance and body position. You should be in the athletic position to prepare catching a ball. The athletic position takes the following into effect: Bend your knees slightly. This will give you the flexibility to lung for the ball and keep your mind focused. Keep your shoulders positioned towards the target. This will make it easier to visualize and react once the ball comes towards you. Stand on the balls of your feet instead of standing flat-footed. 3. Watch the ball. The key to catching a baseball is to never let the ball out of your sight. Keep your eyes fixed from the time the ball leaves the thrower's hand until it lands in your glove. By watching the ball, you can track the ball’s flight plan, and prepare for the right stance to catch the ball. ”You can’t catch what you can’t see,” meaning it'll be difficult to catch the ball if your eye is off the ball. 4. Go to the ball. Don’t feel inclined to stay anchored in one place, but instead move to catch the ball. If the ball is thrown and you can tell it will land behind you, run backwards while watching the ball. In baseball, catchers play by zone defense. When the ball enters your zone, it’s your job to move to it. 5. Position your glove. Hold your glove with your palm facing outwards in front of your body. Position the glove in the direction of the target who is throwing the ball. If the ball is thrown above your belly button, you can use this stance to catch the ball with little adjustment. If the throw is below your belly button, rotate your glove so that your fingers are pointed down. When the ball is thrown above your body, use the first position mentioned, but extend your arm upwards. 6. Catch the baseball. Catch the ball in the pocket of the glove. The pocket is another name for the palm of the glove. Close your hand immediately once the ball makes contact with your glove. Get into the practice of using your second hand to secure the catch. Using your second hand will also prepare you to throw once you become a catcher. Your free hand needs to have quick access to the ball. 7. Keep your vision clear. Be careful not to obstruct your vision with your glove when going for the catch. If a ball is heading towards your face, move your glove to the position at the last second. This might take some practice, but the goal is to watch the ball till the final second. Practice throwing with a friend to avoid a black eye on game day. You can usually reposition yourself to avoid your face crossing the ball’s flight path.",

Use two hands\n   • As the ball hits the pocket, cover it with your throwing hand immediately.\n\n6. Funnel to your chest\n   • Bring the glove to the center of your body to secure it and prepare a throw or tag.\n\n7. Communicate & position\n   • For fly balls say “Mine!” and take priority if you have the easier angle. Avoid backpedaling—turn and run to the spot, then get set.\n\n8. Bare-hand (only on soft tosses/foul balls in the stands)\n   • Keep fingers together, elbows slightly bent, and **give** with the ball. Avoid trying to bare-hand hard line drives.\n\n9.

Above that, lighter gases become more common (start of the **heterosphere**).\n* **Ionosphere:** Not a separate “layer” by altitude alone; it **overlaps** the mesosphere/thermosphere (\\~60–1,000 km) and is defined by ionization from solar radiation (important for auroras and radio).\n\nIf you’d like, I can add typical Celsius/°F scale values on the temperature curve or include example altitudes for planes, balloons, meteors, the ISS, and GPS satellites.\n",

    "reference_text": "An example input volume is shown in red (e.g. a 32x32x3 CIFAR-10 image), and an example volume of neurons in the first Convolutional layer is shown in blue. Each neuron in this layer is connected only to a local spatial region in the input volume, but spans the full depth (i.e. all color channels). There are multiple neurons (5 in this example) along the depth, each using a different filter. These neurons share the same receptive field but not weights. On the right, a neuron is depicted using the standard neural network model: it computes a weighted sum of inputs followed by a non-linearity (activation function), with connectivity restricted spatially in CNNs.",

    "generated_text": "Alright, here’s how a CNN layer processes an image:\n\n1. **Input Image**: A CNN starts with an image, which is represented as a matrix of pixel values. Each pixel has color channels (e.g., RGB).\n\n2. **Convolution Operation**: In a CNN layer, a small matrix called a filter (or kernel) slides over the image. This filter performs a dot product between itself and the section of the image it’s currently covering. It moves across the entire image, extracting features like edges, textures, or patterns.\n\n3. **Neurons**: Each neuron in the CNN layer corresponds to one region of the image processed by the filter. After the filter slides over an area of the image, the result of the convolution is passed to a neuron, which computes the weighted sum of the values and then applies an activation function (like ReLU).\n\n4. **Activation**: After the neuron processes the result, it passes the output to the next layer or saves it for further processing.\n\nNow I’ll generate an image to visualize this process. Please give me a moment.\n",
