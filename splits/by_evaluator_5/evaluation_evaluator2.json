Then, Use a series of connected curved lines to draw the bushes and trees visible in the distance. 2. 2. Draw more shrubbery on the horizon using a series of connected curved lines. Then, draw a tree towering above the rest. Extend a pair of lines for the trunk, and use a curved line to enclose the tree's crown. 3. 3. Draw more trees on the horizon. Again, extend a pair of lines for the trunk, and use a curved line to enclose the tree's crown. 4. 4. Draw two large \"U\" shaped lines to outline the rainbow. Draw the sun peeking out from behind it. Use a curved line to enclose the partial circle at the center of the sun. Then, use a series of straight lines that meet at points to draw its zig zag-shaped rays. 5. 5. Draw \"U\" shaped lines within the rainbow, parallel to the outer lines, to demarcate the different colors. Then draw a daisy flower growing on the hillside. Start with an oval for the center of the flower, and \"U\" shaped lines for the petals. Draw a line below it to form the stem and a teardrop-shaped leaf on one side. 6. 6. Draw another daisy on the hillside. Again, start with an oval for the center of the flower, and \"U\" shaped lines for the petals. Nearby, draw a tulip using curved lines. Draw a line below each flower to form the stem, and a teardrop-shaped leaf on one side. 7. 7. Draw more tulips and daisies. Again, use an oval and \"U\" shaped lines for the daisy and curved lines for the tulip. Then, draw a line below each flower to form the stem and a teardrop-shaped leaf on one side. 8. 8. Draw another tulip, then some butterflies fluttering about. Use \"U\" shaped lines to form each of the butterflies' four wings. 9. 9. Complete your rainbow for kids outline by drawing clouds in the sky. Use a straight line for the bottom of each cloud and a series of curved lines for the fluffy top. 10. Color your cartoon rainbow for kids. Do you know the order of the rainbow's colors? You can remember them with the made-up name Roy G. Biv. Each letter stands for a color.

    "reference_text": "1. 1. Begin by drawing a circle to outline the shape of the watermelon. 2. 2. Use curved lines to outline a \"T\" shape extending from the top of the watermelon. Erase guide lines as necessary. This forms the watermelon's stem. 3. 3. Draw two sets of wavy lines extending downward from the stem. Allow one to reach the opposite side of the watermelon. For the other pair, allow the lines to meet in a sharp point. These form the first of the watermelon's characteristic stripes. 4. 4. Draw two more stripes. Extend one set of lines down from the stem, the other up from the bottom of the melon. Allow each to end in a sharp point. 5. 5. Draw more stripes across the watermelon, filling the empty spaces. 6. 6. Next, you will draw a slice of cut watermelon. Draw a wide \"U\" shaped line, allowing it to overlap the completed watermelon. Then, connect the ends of the \"U\" using a straight line. 7. 7. Give the slice a three dimensional shape by drawing a curved line from one corner of the shape to the bottom of the shape. 8. 8. Erase the guide lines from behind the watermelon slice. 9. 9. Detail the inside of the slice. Draw a curved line parallel to the original \"U\" shaped line. This separates the green and flavorless rind from the sweet, pink fruit. Then, draw seeds. Use a teardrop shape for each seed. Notice how the seeds are positioned in a circular pattern, with the pointed end of the teardrop toward the center. 10. 10. Color your watermelon. The outside of the watermelon is typically striped in shades of green. The center of the melon is often pink, red, orange, or yellow.",

Fill the rind band a light green and the very outer edge a darker green. Color the seeds black.\n\n**Step 7 — Shading**\nDeepen the red slightly near the rind for a subtle gradient. Add a light, soft shadow under the slice so it sits on the page.\n\n**Step 8 — Highlights & finish**\nAdd tiny white glints on a few seeds and along the top curve. Thicken the outer outline a touch for a bold, finished look.\n\n**Optional tweaks**\n\n* Add a small “bite” notch on the top curve and adjust the seeds around it.\n* Sprinkle a couple of pale freckles on the pulp for texture.\n* Turn it into a wedge on a plate by sketching a thin oval and resting the slice on it.\n\nWant a version with fewer or more steps (e.g., a 4-step kid-friendly version)?

In the lower half of the circle, draw a pie chart or Pacman shape - a circle with a missing triangular slice. What does a Pacman shape look like, exactly? Check out this Pacman pixel art . Below each eye, extend two curved lines. These are the snail's eyestalks. Then, connect the stalks with an overlapping curved line, contouring the snail's face. 2. 2. Continue the line of the face. This line should be long and wavy, outlining the bottom of the sticky, slimy foot. 3. 3. Draw another wavy line roughly parallel to the foot, allowing the lines to meet at a point. Draw two curved lines across the face, forming the smiling mouth and the chin. Place a short curved line at the corner of the mouth. 4. 4. Extend the remaining side of the head with a long curved line. Double the line back on itself at the end to begin constructing the base of the shell. Connect the tip of the foot to the shell with a curved line. 5. 5. Begin the spiral shape of the snail shell by drawing a large \"C\" shaped line. Connect it to the snail's head with a short line. 6. 6. Continue the line of the shell to enclose the circle. Continue the line past the point of completion to begin the spiral pattern. 7. 7. Continue the spiral-shaped line. 8. 8. Enclose partial circles all along the spiral line. Notice that the circles grow smaller near the inside of the spiral. 9. 9. Fill the snail shell with more circular spots. Color your cartoon snail. We've given ours a green and yellow body with a tan and brown spotted snail. 10. Throughout much of the world, garden snails are usually brown in color. But some snails - especially the ocean and marsh-dwelling snails - have vivid black-and-white patterns or unusually bright colors .",

    "question": "How to Exfoliate Your Body for Soft Skin? Provide a visual guide and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Have a bath or shower. While not part of the exfoliating process per se, immersing your body in hot water will open up your pores, making your skin much more susceptible to cleaning. It also helps to do this process in the bathroom, as you'll need a ready supply of hot water and somewhere to wash away the dead skin flakes once they've been scrubbed off. Use a skin-friendly, perfume-free detergent for bath and allow at least 15 minutes to soften (macerating) the skin surface. It is good when the skin surface looks a bit \"deformed\". Remove \"dead skin\" by rubbing it away with your hands. It will work well, especially at your feet, toes and heels. 2. Get a textured sponge to wash your skin. Tending to your skin with it will help rub away excess skin flakes, leaving your skin softer and cleaner than before. It is recommended you have a sponge ready for use once you have finished up your shower. It should feel slightly rough on your skin, but if it's abrasive to the point of pain, exfoliating wash cloths are a suitable, gentler alternative. Exfoliating can also be done with a rough washcloth. A natural bristle brush makes for a good alternative, particularly while scrubbing the backs of arms or legs. If you're the do-it-yourself type, you might look into making your own loofah from home. 3. Scrub your body gently with your sponge starting from the ankles upward. Scrub the sponge over your skin in small, circular motions. Make sure to apply some pressure to feel the sponge's rough texture on your skin; that way, it will rub the surface-layer dead skin away. Starting at the ankles is recommended because it helps to encourage positive blood circulation during the exfoliation process. healthglamour.com/how-to-exfoliate-the-body/ If you're exfoliating your entire body, make sure to give extra attention to your heels, elbows, and knees. These are generally considered to be the driest parts of one's skin, and should be given greater attention accordingly. 4. Add wet sand or salt to your full body exfoliation. If you've ever walked along the beach barefoot, you may have noticed your foot callouses soften. Sand granules are a naturally occurring exfoliant, and their grainy texture is well-suited to scraping away your excess skin flakes. Salt scrubs do the same thing. You can find sand and salt exfoliating products at any store that sells beauty and skincare products. Be forewarned: Using sand in the bath can cause a bigger mess than more common exfoliants. Although it is recommended to try it out at least once, it may not be the best course of action if you don't have the added time in your routine available to do a bit of cleaning up afterwards. Getting sand down a drain could completely ruin the plumbing pipes if done often. If using sand, it should be cleaned, even bleached, because getting it from outdoors could introduce bacteria and using that to exfoliate would do more harm than good. Choose sand with small granules, not big, because the smaller granules are more gentle on the skin. Focus on the tougher skin of the arms and legs because sand can be more intense than exfoliating scrubs. 5. Rinse with hot water. Closing up shop with a body rinse is a relaxing and effective way to finish your exfoliation. Although it's recommended you repeat this process at least three times a week, you should notice an immediate softness with your skin. Applying a moisturizer or shea butter following your rinse, even following an otherwise purely 'mechanical' cleanse, will help your skin better retain moisture.",

Skip if skin is inflamed.\n* **Chemical (acids/actives):**\n\n  * **AHAs** (lactic, glycolic): dry/dull or uneven texture.\n  * **BHA** (salicylic): body breakouts, clogged pores, ingrowns.\n  * **PHA** (gluconolactone, lactobionic): very sensitive skin.\n  * **Urea** (10–20%): rough bumps/keratosis pilaris (KP).\n\n## 2) Step-by-step routine (shower days)\n\n1. **Soak** in warm (not hot) water for 5–10 min.\n2. **Cleanse** with a gentle, non-stripping body wash.\n3. **Exfoliate**\n\n   * *Physical:* massage with light pressure in small circles for 30–60 sec per area; avoid chest/neck if sensitive.\n   * *Chemical:* apply a thin layer per label. Rinse-off: 1–3 min. Leave-on lotions: use a light, even coat—don’t scrub.\n4. **Rinse & pat dry** (don’t rub).\n5. **Moisturize within 3 minutes.** Look for glycerin, hyaluronic acid, ceramides; for very dry skin, seal with a light oil/occlusive.\n6. **Daytime SPF 30+** on exposed areas (AHAs/BHAs increase sun sensitivity).\n\n## 3) How often?\n\n* **Sensitive:** 1×/week (soft cloth or PHA).\n* **Normal/combination:** 1–2×/week.\n* **Dry/KP-prone:** 2–3×/week (lactic acid or urea, avoid gritty scrubs).\n* **Oily/acne-prone:** 2–3×/week BHA on problem zones (back, chest).\n\n> Signs you’re overdoing it: stinging that lasts, tightness, shiny but fragile skin, more redness or breakouts. Cut back to once weekly.\n\n## 4) Do’s & don’ts\n\n**Do**\n\n* Use gentle pressure; let products do the work.\n* Rinse mitts/cloths after each use; wash weekly; replace loofahs monthly.\n* Exfoliate **before** shaving (same session is OK for gentle physical or mild rinse-off acids).\n* Moisturize every time.\n\n**Don’t**\n\n* Exfoliate on sunburn, open cuts, or active eczema/psoriasis flares.\n* Mix strong actives on the same day (e.g., retinoids + strong acids).\n* Exfoliate right after waxing/laser; wait **48–72 hours**.\n* Use very hot water.\n\n## 5) Targeted tips\n\n* **Ingrown hairs/razor bumps:** Use BHA 0.5–2% the day **before** shaving and again 24–48 h after; shave with slip (gel/cream) in hair-growth direction.\n* **Keratosis pilaris:** Daily urea 10–20% or lactic acid 5–12% lotion; brief gentle physical buffing 2–3×/week; be patient (4–6 weeks).\n* **Feet/elbows/knees:** Can tolerate slightly stronger scrubs—keep separate tools for feet.\n\n## 6) Simple weekly template\n\n* **Mon:** BHA on back/chest after shower → moisturize.\n* **Wed:** Gentle washcloth buff head-to-toe → moisturize.\n* **Fri:** Lactic-acid or urea body lotion (leave-on) at night.\n* **Sun (optional):** Spot-treat rough patches only.\n\n*Friendly reminder:* If you’re pregnant/nursing or on prescription topicals, check product safety first.

    "question": "How to wash your face properly? Provide illustrated steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. A mild cleanser cleans skin gently without irritation. No matter what skin type you have, for daily cleansing, pick a face wash that’s fragrance- and alcohol-free. Using cleansers that are too harsh can strip your skin of its natural oils, leading to breakouts and dry skin. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source First, figure out what skin type you have , then check out our cleanser recommendations below: For oily or acne-prone skin: Oil-free cleanser (that won’t clog pores) [2] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source For dry skin: Hydrating cleanser (to moisturize while you wash) For combination or normal skin: Gentle foaming cleanser (to cleanse dirt and grime gently) For sensitive skin: Fragrance-free cleanser (to avoid irritating skin) For aging skin: Gentle cleanser (to cleanse dirt and grime without drying) 2. Take off your makeup to avoid clogged pores. Face cleansers are meant to cleanse your skin, not remove makeup. If you like to wear makeup during the day, use a gentle makeup remover on a cotton pad to take everything off before washing your face. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you have acne-prone or oily skin, go for a water-based makeup remover (instead of an oil-based one) to avoid clogged pores. 3. Use lukewarm water to gently wet your skin. Hot water strips your skin of its natural oils, and cold water doesn’t remove dirt and grime effectively. Turn your tap to a temperature that’s just above room temp, then splash your face with water. If you have long hair, pull it back into a bun or ponytail before you start washing your face. This will make it much easier to cleanse your skin. 4. Gently apply face wash to your skin in a circular motion. Pour a coin-sized amount of cleanser onto your hands, then rub your palms together to lather it up. Rub the cleanser all over your face, including your cheeks, nose, forehead, chin, and jawline for about 10 seconds. Using a washcloth or a cleansing device to wash your face might sound like a good idea, but actually, they can be too harsh on your skin. For daily cleansing, just use your hands. Don’t use cleanser around your eyes. The skin there is so delicate that it rarely needs cleansing—just splashing the area with water will do. 5. Be gentle with your skin as you rinse and dry to avoid irritation. Use lukewarm water again, and splash it onto your face to rinse off the cleanser. Grab a clean towel and pat your skin dry, trying not to rub or scrub your face. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Rubbing your skin with a towel can be irritating, which can lead to dry skin or acne breakouts. Be sure to dry your skin with a clean towel. Using a dirty towel can introduce bacteria into your skin, which can lead to clogged pores. 6. Use toner to tackle red marks or dark spots. Using a toner is totally optional, and not everyone needs one in their skincare routine. However, using a toner can help smooth out your skin tone and complexion. To add a toner to your skincare routine, pour a pea-sized amount onto a cotton swab and gently rub it into your skin right after cleansing. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For oily or acne-prone skin: Cleansing toner (to prevent breakouts) For dry skin: Hydrating toner (to moisturize throughout the day) For combination or normal skin: Toner with witch hazel and aloe (to smooth skin and close the pores) For sensitive skin: Soothing toner (for hydration without irritation) For aging skin: Toner with vitamin C (to hydrate and plump skin) If you use serums, acne cream, or other products on your skin, now is the time to apply those as well. 7. Apply moisturizer to lock in hydration after cleansing. Washing your face is very drying, and all skin types need some moisture afterward. Find a moisturizer that’s for your skin type, then rub moisturizer all over your skin with your fingertips. [8] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source For oily or acne-prone skin: Hydrating gel [9] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source For dry skin: Thick salve or ointment For combination or normal skin: Moisturizing lotion For sensitive skin: Fragrance-free moisturizer For aging skin: Cream-based moisturizer [10] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source 8. Cleanse your skin in the morning and at night to keep it clean. Experts recommend washing your face 2 times per day, or after you sweat. This will help keep your skin clean and avoid oil-buildup and breakouts. [11] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Overwashing your face can be just as damaging as not washing it enough. Although it might seem like a good idea to cleanse your skin more often throughout the day, your face needs its natural oils to function. Try to stick to washing once in the morning and once at night for the best results. If you feel like your skin needs a refresh during the day, splash it with lukewarm water and then pat your face dry. This will help wipe away any excess oil or grime on your skin. Don’t feel like you need to include a whole slew of products in order to have a great routine. Try adding in products one at a time to figure out what works best for you! Reader Poll: We asked 871 wikiHow readers about what products make up their daily skincare routine, and 56% of them shared that they use just water and maybe one product . [Take Poll] 9. Exfoliating removes dead skin cells and opens up your pores. Over-exfoliating can be drying and can lead to breakouts, so try to exfoliate instead of washing your face no more than once a week. To exfoliate, wet your skin with lukewarm water, then gently rub a chemical exfoliant or a physical exfoliant onto your skin. Rinse your skin with lukewarm water, pat it dry, then follow up with a moisturizer. [12] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Chemical exfoliants are better for dry or sensitive skin, and physical exfoliants are better for normal or oily skin. Exfoliating is very drying, so always follow up with a moisturizer afterwards. 10. Use sunscreen to prevent dark marks and hyperpigmentation. An important part of your skin care routine is using SPF 30 or higher sunscreen every day. Apply it after your moisturizer and before your makeup (if you wear it) to protect against UV rays when you head outside. Make sure to reapply your sunscreen every 2 hours, or as often as the bottle tells you to. If you have oily skin, look for an oil-free sunscreen to avoid clogged pores or breakouts. For all other skin types, look for a sunscreen that’s formulated for your face. Remember, UV rays are always there, even on cloudy days! Sunscreen will protect your skin even when you can’t see the sun.",

Tighten your abs and push your lower back flat against the mat the entire time you’re performing crunches to ensure your core stays engaged. If you don’t have an exercise mat, then lay out a soft towel or do crunches on a carpeted floor so you’re more comfortable. 2. Bend your knees so your feet are flat on the floor. Position your feet so your heels are about 12 to 18 in (30 to 46 cm) from your tailbone. Bend your knees to 90 degrees and keep them about hip-width apart. Make sure the soles of your feet are flat against the ground. 3. Cross your arms in front of your chest with your hands just below your shoulders. Keep your elbows pointed down toward your feet. Lay your hands flat on your chest right in front of your shoulders. Avoid putting your hands behind your head since you could accidentally strain your neck when you perform your exercise. For more resistance during your workout, hold a 5 to 10 pounds (2.3 to 4.5 kg) plate weight over your chest. 4. Lift your shoulder blades off of the mat with a smooth, controlled motion. Tighten your abs and take a deep breath in. As you exhale, engage your muscles to raise your torso off of the mat all while keeping your lower back and feet flat on the floor. Lift yourself just enough to get your shoulder blades off of the floor. Support yourself in this position for 1–2 seconds. Avoid sitting all the way up when you perform a crunch since muscles in your back and hips will take over, and you could strain yourself. Keep your lower back, tailbone, and feet in contact with the mat at all times. If your feet lift off of the ground while you’re performing a rep, have someone hold onto your feet or position them underneath something heavy. Keep your neck relaxed instead of tucking in your chin. Try to keep an apple-sized space between your chin and your chest. Looking at the ceiling can help keep you from curling your neck too much. 5. Lower yourself back down with a slow, steady motion. Gently inhale as you slowly lower your torso down to the floor. Use a smooth, controlled motion to work your ab muscles and prevent you from injuring yourself. Take a brief pause to finish 1 rep. If you rush into the next rep, you’ll end up using the momentum of your body moving instead of your muscles to lift yourself up. Additionally, you’re more likely to injure your back Try doing a set of 10–12 crunches to start working out your abs . As you start building up your core strength, try doing 2–3 sets or increasing the number of reps you do.",

    "question": "How to Juggle a Soccer Ball? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Hold the ball straight out in front of you so that it is at the height of your chest. Drop it and let it bounce. As the ball begins to descend after this bounce, kick it back up into the air. Try to kick it with your dominant foot hard enough that it reaches chest height. Try to kick the ball with your foot angled slightly upward. Make sure to kick the ball with your laces. Make sure that your laces are not double knotted at first. The ball may bounce off of your laces at a weird angle if your laces are tied in a large knot. If you deflate the soccer ball a little bit, you will reduce the intensity of its bounce. The ball will be easier to control and won’t go flying every time you miss a kick. Once you’ve mastered the technique of juggling, you should fully inflate your ball. Keep your ankle 'locked' so that it stays angled and strong. A wobbly ankle leads to a wobbly kick. 2. Keep your knees slightly bent. Doing this will help you have better control over the ball. Do not lock your knees. Keep the foot you are not kicking with (your controlling foot) flat and firmly planted on the ground. It is important to be balanced while juggling the ball. In between touches, it is risky but useful to try to re-balance yourself such that you can maintain control of how you hit the ball each time. Always try to stay balanced on your toes, ready to make quick movements. The biggest key to balancing is to keep your knees bent and your eyes on the ball. 3. Practice until you can easily and consistently catch the ball in front of your stomach. You should not have to lean or reach to catch the ball. Then do the same with your other foot. Keep in mind that juggling with your non-dominant foot will be harder. Keep at it! 4. Increase the number of times you let the ball bounce off your feet. Instead of catching the ball every time you kick it, kick it up into the air and as it falls, kick it up again rather than letting it bounce on the ground. Try to keep the ball under control. Focus on juggling with one foot until you feel confident, then switch to the other foot. Practice until you feel confident juggling with both feet. You can \"catch\" the ball on your foot with careful practice by cushioning the fall of the ball and holding it in place with your foot and shin.",

First touch (“pop”)\n\n* Drop the ball, let it bounce once.\n* Lift your dominant foot; toes slightly up, ankle locked.\n* Strike the bottom-center with your laces so it rises to about waist height.\n\n3. Catch & reset\n\n* After one pop, catch the ball with your hands.\n* Repeat until the touch feels consistent and the ball goes straight up.\n\n4. Two pops, same foot\n\n* Drop → bounce → pop → bounce → pop → catch.\n* Keep touches light, ball close to your body, tiny hop on your standing foot.\n\n5. Alternate feet with a bounce\n\n* Right foot pop, bounce, left foot pop, bounce, catch.\n* Keep the ball centered between your feet.\n\n6. Continuous (no bounce)\n\n* Pop with one foot and, before it drops too far, pop with the other.\n* Aim for knee-to-waist height; stay balanced with small, light hops.\n\n7. Add thighs\n\n* When the ball rises too high for your feet, cushion and lift with your thigh.\n* Keep knees level; hit the mid-thigh so the ball goes straight up.\n\n8. Mix surfaces & control\n\n* Combine feet and thighs in a rhythm (R foot → L foot → R thigh → L foot, etc.).\n* Keep your torso quiet, eyes on the lower half of the ball, ankle locked on every touch.\n\n9. Build consistency (mini goals)\n\n* 5 touches total → 10 → 20 without moving much from your spot.\n* Then try “weak foot only” sets.\n\n10. Quick fixes for common mistakes\n\n* Ball drifting forward: lean slightly over the ball; strike more under the center.\n* Spinning ball: hit with a firm, flat laces surface; avoid toe-poking.\n* Popping too high: relax and hit lighter; aim for consistent knee-to-waist height.\n* Chasing the ball: take smaller hops and keep it centered between your shoulders.\n\nWant a version that adds heading (forehead) or chest control next?",

Keep in mind that this movement is not recommended for anyone who has ever had a back problem. This movement can be made easier by placing your hands and arms lower on your body (crossing arms in front of your chest) or harder, by placing your hands and arms past your head (arms extended above your head). 2. Turn your legs to one side. With your knees remaining bent, turn at your waist and bring both of your legs to one side of your body, down to the floor. Your legs should be lying on top of each other. As you bring your legs down to the floor, keep your shoulder blades and the upper part of your back flat on the floor. Your rib cage should be down and not flared out in this position. If you overextend, you risk straining your upper back. [4] X Expert Source Brendon Rearick Personal Trainer & Strength Coach Expert Interview 3. Crunch to your side. Place your hands behind or at the sides of your head. Flex your abdominal muscles, and lift your shoulders off the floor. Be sure to keep your shoulders straight and level just as you would for a normal crunch. Hold the position for a moment, then release your constricted abdominal muscles to slowly bring your shoulders back down to the mat. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Do not pull at your head and neck to complete the crunch. Your hands are merely resting near your head as you contract your abdominal muscles to lift yourself up and crunch.

Breathing properly will put your diaphragm in a better position for abdominal work. [8] X Expert Source Brendon Rearick Personal Trainer & Strength Coach Expert Interview 4. Complete your crunches on the other side of your body. Once you have completed one set of crunches on one side of your body (about 10–15 reps), turn your legs over to do the crunches on other side of your body.

The break starts at the hypocenter (focus) at depth and spreads along the fault.\n4.\tSeismic waves: Stored elastic energy radiates as P and S waves that shake the ground.

Light from the **illuminator** is focused through the specimen by the **condenser**. The **objective** forms a **real, inverted intermediate image** inside the tube; the **eyepiece** then magnifies that into the **virtual image** you see.\n\n**Total magnification = (eyepiece power) × (objective power).**\n**Resolution** (smallest detail you can separate) improves with higher **NA** of the objective/condenser and with shorter wavelengths of light.\n\n## What each numbered part does (match to the image)\n\n1. **Eyepiece (ocular)** – Magnifies the intermediate image made by the objective; often 10×. Some models include a **diopter** ring to match focus between your eyes.\n\n2. **Head / Body tube** – Holds the optics at fixed spacing so the objective image forms at the correct plane for the eyepiece.\n\n3. **Revolving nosepiece (turret)** – Clicks different **objective lenses** into the light path quickly.\n\n4. **Objectives (4×, 10×, 40×, 100× oil)** – The primary magnifiers; also the main drivers of **resolution** and **working distance**.\n\n   * **4× (scanning):** wide field, easy to find the specimen.\n   * **10× (low):** more detail, still forgiving.\n   * **40× (high dry):** fine detail; use **fine focus only**.\n   * **100× oil:** highest detail; requires immersion oil to boost NA and resolution.\n\n5. **Stage** – Platform that holds the slide. Often a **mechanical stage** with **X–Y controls** for precise movement.\n\n6. **Slide & stage clips** – Secure the specimen directly over the light path.\n\n7. **Coarse focus knob** – Moves the stage quickly to find focus at low power.\n\n8. **Fine focus knob** – Small, precise motion for sharp focus, especially at 40×/100×.\n\n9. **Condenser** – A lens system that concentrates light onto the specimen; usually raised close to the underside of the slide for brightfield.\n\n10. **Iris diaphragm (substage)** – Adjustable aperture beneath the condenser. **Open** for brightness and resolution; **close** for more contrast (but less resolution). Use together with the condenser height.\n\n11. **Field diaphragm (if present)** – Controls the illuminated field size; helps set Köhler illumination and reduce stray light.\n\n12. **Illuminator / LED** – The light source. Often paired with a **brightness control** on the base.\n\n13. **On/Off & brightness control** – Powers the lamp and sets intensity to a comfortable, non-glary level.\n\n14. **Arm** – Structural support; the safe handle when carrying the scope (other hand under the base).\n\n15. **Base & power connector** – House the lamp and electronics; provides stability.\n\n### What’s happening to the image?\n\n* **Illuminator → condenser → specimen:** Light is focused into a cone that passes through the specimen. Transparent/colored areas transmit or absorb light differently, creating contrast.\n* **Specimen → objective:** The objective produces a **real, inverted** magnified image inside the tube.\n* **Objective image → eyepiece:** The eyepiece acts like a magnifier, creating a **virtual image** your eye focuses on.\n* **Result:** High magnification with limited depth of field; tiny focus adjustments and proper illumination are crucial.\n\nIf you want, I can make a printable one-page “How it works + parts” handout using this same diagram.\n",

    "reference_text": "The diagram shows the structures of the respiratory system. They include the nose, trachea, lungs, and diaphragm. The diaphragm is a large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs. When you inhale, air enters the respiratory system through your nose and ends up in your lungs, where gas exchange with the blood takes place. In the nose, mucus and hairs trap any dust or other particles in the air. The air is also warmed and moistened so it wont harm delicate tissues of the lungs. Next, air passes through the pharynx, a passageway that is shared with the digestive system. From the pharynx, the air passes next through the larynx, or voice box. After the larynx, air moves into the trachea, or wind pipe. This is a long tube that leads down to the lungs in the chest. In the chest, the trachea divides as it enters the lungs to form the right and left bronchi (bronchus, singular). These passages are covered with mucus and tiny hairs called cilia. The mucus traps any remaining particles in the air. The cilia move and sweep the particles and mucus toward the throat so they can be expelled from the body. Air passes from the bronchi into smaller passages called bronchioles. The bronchioles end in clusters of tiny air sacs called alveoli (alveolus, singular). The alveoli in the lungs are where gas exchange between the air and blood takes place. Shown also is the rib (or ribs) the protect the lungs and other vital organs within the chest.",

    "generated_text": "# Text Explanation (separate from the image)\n\n## Big picture\n\nYour respiratory system is a branching network that conducts air to millions of tiny sacs (alveoli) where gas exchange happens. It’s often divided into:\n\n* **Upper respiratory tract:** nose/nostrils, nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, and pharynx (throat).\n* **Lower respiratory tract:** larynx (voice box), trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and lungs (ending in alveoli).\n* **Supporting structures:** chest wall, **diaphragm**, intercostal muscles, and the **pleura** (the double-layer lining around the lungs).\n\n## The parts, in order\n\n1. **Nostrils (nares) & nasal vestibule** – entry points. Nose hairs and mucus trap dust; blood-rich lining warms and humidifies air.\n   *(If you breathe through your mouth, the first steps below are bypassed.)*\n2. **Nasal cavity & turbinates** – twisty shelves that swirl air to filter, warm, and moisten it; smell receptors live high up.\n3. **Paranasal sinuses** (frontal, maxillary, ethmoid, sphenoid) – air-filled spaces that lighten the skull and condition air; drain into the nasal cavity.\n4. **Pharynx (throat)** – three regions:\n\n   * **Nasopharynx** (behind the nose)\n   * **Oropharynx** (behind the mouth; food + air share this space)\n   * **Laryngopharynx** (leads to the larynx for air or esophagus for food)\n5. **Epiglottis** – a leaf-shaped flap that tilts down when you swallow so food doesn’t enter the airway.\n6. **Larynx (voice box)** – contains vocal cords; the opening between them is the **glottis**.\n7. **Trachea (windpipe)** – rigid tube with C-shaped cartilage rings; lined with cilia that sweep debris upward (the “mucociliary escalator”).\n8. **Carina** – the tracheal split.\n9. **Main bronchi** – right and left primary branches; the **right main bronchus** is shorter, wider, and more vertical (aspired objects lodge here more often).\n10. **Lobar (secondary) bronchi** – one to each lung lobe (3 right, 2 left).\n11. **Segmental (tertiary) bronchi** – supply bronchopulmonary segments.\n12. **Conducting bronchioles → terminal bronchioles** – small airways without cartilage; still just conducting air (no gas exchange yet).\n13. **Respiratory bronchioles → alveolar ducts → alveolar sacs → alveoli** – the **respiratory zone** where oxygen enters blood and carbon dioxide leaves across the ultra-thin alveolar–capillary membrane. Type II cells make **surfactant** to keep alveoli open.\n\n**Around the lungs:**\n\n* **Pleura:** visceral layer on the lung, parietal layer on the chest wall; a thin fluid layer lets lungs glide during breathing.\n* **Diaphragm & intercostals:** main breathing muscles.\n\n## How air travels (step-by-step)\n\n1. **Inhale:** Diaphragm contracts and moves down, ribs lift—chest cavity expands, drawing air in.\n2. **Air path:** Nostrils → nasal cavity (or mouth) → pharynx → past epiglottis → **larynx** → **trachea** → **carina** → **right/left main bronchi** → lobar bronchi → segmental bronchi → bronchioles → terminal bronchioles → **respiratory bronchioles** → **alveolar ducts** → **alveolar sacs** → **alveoli**.\n3. **Gas exchange:** Oxygen diffuses from alveoli to blood; carbon dioxide diffuses from blood to alveoli.\n4. **Exhale:** Diaphragm relaxes and moves up; lungs recoil and air flows out along the same path in reverse.\n\n## Quick memory trick\n\n**“N-N-P-L-T-B-B-b-b-A”** → Nose, Nasal cavity, Pharynx, Larynx, Trachea, Bronchi (main → lobar → segmental), bronchioles (conducting → terminal), **A**lveoli (via respiratory bronchioles & ducts).\n\n---\n\nIf you’d like, I can add labels or callouts tailored to your study needs (e.g., “conducting vs. respiratory zone,” or a zoom-in on the vocal cords).\n",
