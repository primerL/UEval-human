    "reference_text": "1. 1. Begin the rainbow for kids outline by drawing the hilly ground. use two long curved lines to sketch the overlapping hills. Then, Use a series of connected curved lines to draw the bushes and trees visible in the distance. 2. 2. Draw more shrubbery on the horizon using a series of connected curved lines. Then, draw a tree towering above the rest. Extend a pair of lines for the trunk, and use a curved line to enclose the tree's crown. 3. 3. Draw more trees on the horizon. Again, extend a pair of lines for the trunk, and use a curved line to enclose the tree's crown. 4. 4. Draw two large \"U\" shaped lines to outline the rainbow. Draw the sun peeking out from behind it. Use a curved line to enclose the partial circle at the center of the sun. Then, use a series of straight lines that meet at points to draw its zig zag-shaped rays. 5. 5. Draw \"U\" shaped lines within the rainbow, parallel to the outer lines, to demarcate the different colors. Then draw a daisy flower growing on the hillside. Start with an oval for the center of the flower, and \"U\" shaped lines for the petals. Draw a line below it to form the stem and a teardrop-shaped leaf on one side. 6. 6. Draw another daisy on the hillside. Again, start with an oval for the center of the flower, and \"U\" shaped lines for the petals. Nearby, draw a tulip using curved lines. Draw a line below each flower to form the stem, and a teardrop-shaped leaf on one side. 7. 7. Draw more tulips and daisies. Again, use an oval and \"U\" shaped lines for the daisy and curved lines for the tulip. Then, draw a line below each flower to form the stem and a teardrop-shaped leaf on one side. 8. 8. Draw another tulip, then some butterflies fluttering about. Use \"U\" shaped lines to form each of the butterflies' four wings. 9. 9. Complete your rainbow for kids outline by drawing clouds in the sky. Use a straight line for the bottom of each cloud and a series of curved lines for the fluffy top. 10. Color your cartoon rainbow for kids. Do you know the order of the rainbow's colors? You can remember them with the made-up name Roy G. Biv. Each letter stands for a color.

    "reference_text": "1. 1. Begin by drawing a circle to outline the shape of the watermelon. 2. 2. Use curved lines to outline a \"T\" shape extending from the top of the watermelon. Erase guide lines as necessary. This forms the watermelon's stem. 3. 3. Draw two sets of wavy lines extending downward from the stem. Allow one to reach the opposite side of the watermelon. For the other pair, allow the lines to meet in a sharp point. These form the first of the watermelon's characteristic stripes. 4. 4. Draw two more stripes. Extend one set of lines down from the stem, the other up from the bottom of the melon. Allow each to end in a sharp point. 5. 5. Draw more stripes across the watermelon, filling the empty spaces. 6. 6. Next, you will draw a slice of cut watermelon. Draw a wide \"U\" shaped line, allowing it to overlap the completed watermelon. Then, connect the ends of the \"U\" using a straight line. 7. 7. Give the slice a three dimensional shape by drawing a curved line from one corner of the shape to the bottom of the shape. 8. 8. Erase the guide lines from behind the watermelon slice. 9. 9. Detail the inside of the slice. Draw a curved line parallel to the original \"U\" shaped line. This separates the green and flavorless rind from the sweet, pink fruit. Then, draw seeds. Use a teardrop shape for each seed. Notice how the seeds are positioned in a circular pattern, with the pointed end of the teardrop toward the center. 10. 10. Color your watermelon. The outside of the watermelon is typically striped in shades of green. The center of the melon is often pink, red, orange, or yellow.",

This is the overall slice.\n\n**Step 2 — Rind band**\nInside the arc, add a second, smaller arc that follows the first one. Leave a thin gap between them—this gap is the light-green rind.\n\n**Step 3 — Clean the edges**\nRound the two corners where the arc meets the bottom edge so the slice looks soft and juicy.\n\n**Step 4 — First seeds**\nPlace 5–7 small teardrop shapes across the pulp. Point the narrow ends toward the center.\n\n**Step 5 — Seed variety**\nAdd a few tiny dots or smaller seeds between the larger ones to make it feel natural.\n\n**Step 6 — Base colors**\nColor the pulp a bright red/pink. Fill the rind band a light green and the very outer edge a darker green. Color the seeds black.\n\n**Step 7 — Shading**\nDeepen the red slightly near the rind for a subtle gradient. Add a light, soft shadow under the slice so it sits on the page.\n\n**Step 8 — Highlights & finish**\nAdd tiny white glints on a few seeds and along the top curve. Thicken the outer outline a touch for a bold, finished look.\n\n**Optional tweaks**\n\n* Add a small “bite” notch on the top curve and adjust the seeds around it.\n* Sprinkle a couple of pale freckles on the pulp for texture.\n* Turn it into a wedge on a plate by sketching a thin oval and resting the slice on it.\n\nWant a version with fewer or more steps (e.g., a 4-step kid-friendly version)?

    "reference_text": "1. 1. Begin the cartoon snail outline by drawing the snail's head. First, draw two circles. These will become the snail's eyes. Draw a curved line across each circle. In the lower half of the circle, draw a pie chart or Pacman shape - a circle with a missing triangular slice. What does a Pacman shape look like, exactly? Check out this Pacman pixel art . Below each eye, extend two curved lines. These are the snail's eyestalks. Then, connect the stalks with an overlapping curved line, contouring the snail's face. 2. 2. Continue the line of the face. This line should be long and wavy, outlining the bottom of the sticky, slimy foot. 3. 3. Draw another wavy line roughly parallel to the foot, allowing the lines to meet at a point. Draw two curved lines across the face, forming the smiling mouth and the chin. Place a short curved line at the corner of the mouth. 4. 4. Extend the remaining side of the head with a long curved line. Double the line back on itself at the end to begin constructing the base of the shell. Connect the tip of the foot to the shell with a curved line. 5. 5. Begin the spiral shape of the snail shell by drawing a large \"C\" shaped line. Connect it to the snail's head with a short line. 6. 6. Continue the line of the shell to enclose the circle. Continue the line past the point of completion to begin the spiral pattern. 7. 7. Continue the spiral-shaped line. 8. 8. Enclose partial circles all along the spiral line. Notice that the circles grow smaller near the inside of the spiral. 9. 9. Fill the snail shell with more circular spots. Color your cartoon snail. We've given ours a green and yellow body with a tan and brown spotted snail. 10. Throughout much of the world, garden snails are usually brown in color. But some snails - especially the ocean and marsh-dwelling snails - have vivid black-and-white patterns or unusually bright colors .",

    "question": "How to Exfoliate Your Body for Soft Skin? Provide a visual guide and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Have a bath or shower. While not part of the exfoliating process per se, immersing your body in hot water will open up your pores, making your skin much more susceptible to cleaning. It also helps to do this process in the bathroom, as you'll need a ready supply of hot water and somewhere to wash away the dead skin flakes once they've been scrubbed off. Use a skin-friendly, perfume-free detergent for bath and allow at least 15 minutes to soften (macerating) the skin surface. It is good when the skin surface looks a bit \"deformed\". Remove \"dead skin\" by rubbing it away with your hands. It will work well, especially at your feet, toes and heels. 2. Get a textured sponge to wash your skin. Tending to your skin with it will help rub away excess skin flakes, leaving your skin softer and cleaner than before. It is recommended you have a sponge ready for use once you have finished up your shower. It should feel slightly rough on your skin, but if it's abrasive to the point of pain, exfoliating wash cloths are a suitable, gentler alternative. Exfoliating can also be done with a rough washcloth. A natural bristle brush makes for a good alternative, particularly while scrubbing the backs of arms or legs. If you're the do-it-yourself type, you might look into making your own loofah from home. 3. Scrub your body gently with your sponge starting from the ankles upward. Scrub the sponge over your skin in small, circular motions. Make sure to apply some pressure to feel the sponge's rough texture on your skin; that way, it will rub the surface-layer dead skin away. Starting at the ankles is recommended because it helps to encourage positive blood circulation during the exfoliation process. healthglamour.com/how-to-exfoliate-the-body/ If you're exfoliating your entire body, make sure to give extra attention to your heels, elbows, and knees. These are generally considered to be the driest parts of one's skin, and should be given greater attention accordingly. 4. Add wet sand or salt to your full body exfoliation. If you've ever walked along the beach barefoot, you may have noticed your foot callouses soften. Sand granules are a naturally occurring exfoliant, and their grainy texture is well-suited to scraping away your excess skin flakes. Salt scrubs do the same thing. You can find sand and salt exfoliating products at any store that sells beauty and skincare products. Be forewarned: Using sand in the bath can cause a bigger mess than more common exfoliants. Although it is recommended to try it out at least once, it may not be the best course of action if you don't have the added time in your routine available to do a bit of cleaning up afterwards. Getting sand down a drain could completely ruin the plumbing pipes if done often. If using sand, it should be cleaned, even bleached, because getting it from outdoors could introduce bacteria and using that to exfoliate would do more harm than good. Choose sand with small granules, not big, because the smaller granules are more gentle on the skin. Focus on the tougher skin of the arms and legs because sand can be more intense than exfoliating scrubs. 5. Rinse with hot water. Closing up shop with a body rinse is a relaxing and effective way to finish your exfoliation. Although it's recommended you repeat this process at least three times a week, you should notice an immediate softness with your skin. Applying a moisturizer or shea butter following your rinse, even following an otherwise purely 'mechanical' cleanse, will help your skin better retain moisture.",

Skip if skin is inflamed.\n* **Chemical (acids/actives):**\n\n  * **AHAs** (lactic, glycolic): dry/dull or uneven texture.\n  * **BHA** (salicylic): body breakouts, clogged pores, ingrowns.\n  * **PHA** (gluconolactone, lactobionic): very sensitive skin.\n  * **Urea** (10–20%): rough bumps/keratosis pilaris (KP).\n\n## 2) Step-by-step routine (shower days)\n\n1. **Soak** in warm (not hot) water for 5–10 min.\n2. **Cleanse** with a gentle, non-stripping body wash.\n3. **Exfoliate**\n\n   * *Physical:* massage with light pressure in small circles for 30–60 sec per area; avoid chest/neck if sensitive.\n   * *Chemical:* apply a thin layer per label. Rinse-off: 1–3 min. Leave-on lotions: use a light, even coat—don’t scrub.\n4. **Rinse & pat dry** (don’t rub).\n5. **Moisturize within 3 minutes.** Look for glycerin, hyaluronic acid, ceramides; for very dry skin, seal with a light oil/occlusive.\n6. **Daytime SPF 30+** on exposed areas (AHAs/BHAs increase sun sensitivity).\n\n## 3) How often?\n\n* **Sensitive:** 1×/week (soft cloth or PHA).\n* **Normal/combination:** 1–2×/week.\n* **Dry/KP-prone:** 2–3×/week (lactic acid or urea, avoid gritty scrubs).\n* **Oily/acne-prone:** 2–3×/week BHA on problem zones (back, chest).\n\n> Signs you’re overdoing it: stinging that lasts, tightness, shiny but fragile skin, more redness or breakouts. Cut back to once weekly.\n\n## 4) Do’s & don’ts\n\n**Do**\n\n* Use gentle pressure; let products do the work.\n* Rinse mitts/cloths after each use; wash weekly; replace loofahs monthly.\n* Exfoliate **before** shaving (same session is OK for gentle physical or mild rinse-off acids).\n* Moisturize every time.\n\n**Don’t**\n\n* Exfoliate on sunburn, open cuts, or active eczema/psoriasis flares.\n* Mix strong actives on the same day (e.g., retinoids + strong acids).\n* Exfoliate right after waxing/laser; wait **48–72 hours**.\n* Use very hot water.\n\n## 5) Targeted tips\n\n* **Ingrown hairs/razor bumps:** Use BHA 0.5–2% the day **before** shaving and again 24–48 h after; shave with slip (gel/cream) in hair-growth direction.\n* **Keratosis pilaris:** Daily urea 10–20% or lactic acid 5–12% lotion; brief gentle physical buffing 2–3×/week; be patient (4–6 weeks).\n* **Feet/elbows/knees:** Can tolerate slightly stronger scrubs—keep separate tools for feet.\n\n## 6) Simple weekly template\n\n* **Mon:** BHA on back/chest after shower → moisturize.\n* **Wed:** Gentle washcloth buff head-to-toe → moisturize.\n* **Fri:** Lactic-acid or urea body lotion (leave-on) at night.\n* **Sun (optional):** Spot-treat rough patches only.\n\n*Friendly reminder:* If you’re pregnant/nursing or on prescription topicals, check product safety first.

    "question": "How to wash your face properly? Provide illustrated steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. A mild cleanser cleans skin gently without irritation. No matter what skin type you have, for daily cleansing, pick a face wash that’s fragrance- and alcohol-free. Using cleansers that are too harsh can strip your skin of its natural oils, leading to breakouts and dry skin. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source First, figure out what skin type you have , then check out our cleanser recommendations below: For oily or acne-prone skin: Oil-free cleanser (that won’t clog pores) [2] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source For dry skin: Hydrating cleanser (to moisturize while you wash) For combination or normal skin: Gentle foaming cleanser (to cleanse dirt and grime gently) For sensitive skin: Fragrance-free cleanser (to avoid irritating skin) For aging skin: Gentle cleanser (to cleanse dirt and grime without drying) 2. Take off your makeup to avoid clogged pores. Face cleansers are meant to cleanse your skin, not remove makeup. If you like to wear makeup during the day, use a gentle makeup remover on a cotton pad to take everything off before washing your face. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you have acne-prone or oily skin, go for a water-based makeup remover (instead of an oil-based one) to avoid clogged pores. 3. Use lukewarm water to gently wet your skin. Hot water strips your skin of its natural oils, and cold water doesn’t remove dirt and grime effectively. Turn your tap to a temperature that’s just above room temp, then splash your face with water. If you have long hair, pull it back into a bun or ponytail before you start washing your face. This will make it much easier to cleanse your skin. 4. Gently apply face wash to your skin in a circular motion. Pour a coin-sized amount of cleanser onto your hands, then rub your palms together to lather it up. Rub the cleanser all over your face, including your cheeks, nose, forehead, chin, and jawline for about 10 seconds. Using a washcloth or a cleansing device to wash your face might sound like a good idea, but actually, they can be too harsh on your skin. For daily cleansing, just use your hands. Don’t use cleanser around your eyes. The skin there is so delicate that it rarely needs cleansing—just splashing the area with water will do. 5. Be gentle with your skin as you rinse and dry to avoid irritation. Use lukewarm water again, and splash it onto your face to rinse off the cleanser. Grab a clean towel and pat your skin dry, trying not to rub or scrub your face. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Rubbing your skin with a towel can be irritating, which can lead to dry skin or acne breakouts. Be sure to dry your skin with a clean towel. Using a dirty towel can introduce bacteria into your skin, which can lead to clogged pores. 6. Use toner to tackle red marks or dark spots. Using a toner is totally optional, and not everyone needs one in their skincare routine. However, using a toner can help smooth out your skin tone and complexion. To add a toner to your skincare routine, pour a pea-sized amount onto a cotton swab and gently rub it into your skin right after cleansing. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For oily or acne-prone skin: Cleansing toner (to prevent breakouts) For dry skin: Hydrating toner (to moisturize throughout the day) For combination or normal skin: Toner with witch hazel and aloe (to smooth skin and close the pores) For sensitive skin: Soothing toner (for hydration without irritation) For aging skin: Toner with vitamin C (to hydrate and plump skin) If you use serums, acne cream, or other products on your skin, now is the time to apply those as well. 7. Apply moisturizer to lock in hydration after cleansing. Washing your face is very drying, and all skin types need some moisture afterward. Find a moisturizer that’s for your skin type, then rub moisturizer all over your skin with your fingertips. [8] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source For oily or acne-prone skin: Hydrating gel [9] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source For dry skin: Thick salve or ointment For combination or normal skin: Moisturizing lotion For sensitive skin: Fragrance-free moisturizer For aging skin: Cream-based moisturizer [10] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source 8. Cleanse your skin in the morning and at night to keep it clean. Experts recommend washing your face 2 times per day, or after you sweat. This will help keep your skin clean and avoid oil-buildup and breakouts. [11] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Overwashing your face can be just as damaging as not washing it enough. Although it might seem like a good idea to cleanse your skin more often throughout the day, your face needs its natural oils to function. Try to stick to washing once in the morning and once at night for the best results. If you feel like your skin needs a refresh during the day, splash it with lukewarm water and then pat your face dry. This will help wipe away any excess oil or grime on your skin. Don’t feel like you need to include a whole slew of products in order to have a great routine. Try adding in products one at a time to figure out what works best for you! Reader Poll: We asked 871 wikiHow readers about what products make up their daily skincare routine, and 56% of them shared that they use just water and maybe one product . [Take Poll] 9. Exfoliating removes dead skin cells and opens up your pores. Over-exfoliating can be drying and can lead to breakouts, so try to exfoliate instead of washing your face no more than once a week. To exfoliate, wet your skin with lukewarm water, then gently rub a chemical exfoliant or a physical exfoliant onto your skin. Rinse your skin with lukewarm water, pat it dry, then follow up with a moisturizer. [12] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Chemical exfoliants are better for dry or sensitive skin, and physical exfoliants are better for normal or oily skin. Exfoliating is very drying, so always follow up with a moisturizer afterwards. 10. Use sunscreen to prevent dark marks and hyperpigmentation. An important part of your skin care routine is using SPF 30 or higher sunscreen every day. Apply it after your moisturizer and before your makeup (if you wear it) to protect against UV rays when you head outside. Make sure to reapply your sunscreen every 2 hours, or as often as the bottle tells you to. If you have oily skin, look for an oil-free sunscreen to avoid clogged pores or breakouts. For all other skin types, look for a sunscreen that’s formulated for your face. Remember, UV rays are always there, even on cloudy days! Sunscreen will protect your skin even when you can’t see the sun.",

Maiko Marine Promenade (self-guided)\n\n* What it is: An enclosed observatory walkway built within the lower truss of the bridge. Long corridors with windows and a few glass-floor sections let you look straight down at the Akashi Strait—without being out in the wind.\n* How to do it: Enter from Maiko Park at the base of the bridge on the Kobe side, buy a ticket, and take the elevator up to the promenade level. It’s a simple come-and-go visit that most ages can do.\n* Good to know: It’s indoors and weather-sheltered. Expect museum-style exhibits, viewing lounges, and occasional glass-floor panels. Check local notices for opening days/hours and maintenance closures.\n\n2. “Bridge World” guided tour (for the adventurous)\n\n* What it is: A reservation-only tour run by the bridge authority. You gear up, walk along service catwalks inside the superstructure, and—on some itineraries—ride an internal elevator and stairs to the top of a main tower for a panorama over Kobe and Awaji.\n* How to do it: Book ahead, arrive on time for the safety briefing, and wear comfortable, closed-toe shoes. Capacity is limited and tours are weather-dependent.\n* Good to know: Age/health restrictions may apply; bags are often limited. Tours can be canceled for strong winds or rain.\n\nGetting there (quick orientation)\n\n* Aim for **Maiko Park** on the Kobe side of the strait. The nearest rail stops are around the Maiko area; from there it’s a short walk to the promenade entrance and the bridge exhibition facilities.\n\nTip\n\n* If you prefer an easy, family-friendly indoor stroll with big views, pick the **Maiko Marine Promenade**. If you want a behind-the-scenes engineering experience (and heights don’t bother you), try to snag a **Bridge World** tour.\n",

It was always accessible for maintenance and intentionally shaped to be navigable.\n* **Functional sculptures:** The helmet-like “warriors” are chimney stacks and ventilation towers; their sculptural forms also help manage wind and prevent back-drafts and rain ingress—so they’re both art and infrastructure.\n* **Structural logic below:** The varying roof levels follow the catenary-arch attic structure underneath, creating hills and dips that turn the roof into a walkable topography.\n* **Open to visitors today:** Railings, marked routes, and staffed entry make the space safely accessible as part of the La Pedrera museum experience, so visitors can explore the architecture and the city views.\n",

    "question": "How to Smash in Badminton? Show visual steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Approach the shuttlecock with a forehand grip . Be on your toes and ready to return the shuttle with a smash at any instant. You never know when a smash-worthy shot will present itself. When the shuttle is hit to your end of the court, get underneath and behind it as quickly as possible. The sooner you reach the spot where the shuttle appears to be incoming, the higher it will be and the more time you’ll have to set up a killer smash. You may hear serious badminton players call this kind of maneuver “injection of pace.” All this means is that you add a boost of speed so you have more time to react. 2. Assume a surefooted stance. If the shuttle comes in hot, you might not have a lot of time to react. In ideal conditions, both of your feet will be pointing to the side of the court. Your feet should be about shoulder width apart, your knees slightly bent, and your eyes tracking the ball. Balance is more important at this point than winding up for your smash. If you’re not well-balanced, it’ll negatively impact your smash. 3. Raise your arms and prepare to strike. Hold your racket upright and as far back as possible while still being comfortable. The arm of your non-racket hand should be bent at the elbow and the hand should be at about chin level. The fingers of your non-racket hand can be positioned however you like. Curling your fingers into a fist is most popular, but you can leave them spread out, too. As you prepare to strike, imagine the angle the shuttle will travel. It should be as steep downward as possible while still making it over the net. Raising your non-racket hand will act as a counterbalance for your racket hand, providing greater stability for your smash. 4. Strike the shuttlecock. Aim to connect with the shuttle at the highest point possible. Inhale deeply before you swing and stretch out your non-racket arm so it's roughly shoulder level. Swing with your full racket-arm and exhale as you do so. As you swing, your racket foot should shuffle forward. Power is important at this point, but even more important is hitting the shuttle with the center of the racket. When you feel the racket come in contact with the shuttle, snap your wrist downward. This will add power and steepness to the stroke. You can increase the power of your smash by contracting your abs at the same time you swing at the shuttle. 5. Follow through with your swing and recover for the next rally. An overhead smash will be much more difficult for your opponent(s) to return. But in the event they manage to get it back over the net, you’ll need to be ready to send it right back.",

    "generated_text": "Here are the **text steps** (separate from the image):\n\n1. Grip\n   Use a relaxed forehand “handshake” grip (not panhandle). V-shape between thumb and index sits on the bevel. Keep fingers loose so you can tighten at impact.\n\n2. Ready stance + split step\n   Face the net, feet wider than shoulders, knees bent, racket up. As your opponent hits, make a light split step to react.\n\n3. Move back & turn sideways\n   Chassé or scissor-step to the rear court. Turn your body so your non-racket shoulder points toward the net.\n\n4. Load the swing\n   Non-racket arm points up at the shuttle for balance. Elbow high, racket head drops behind you; chest and hips coil.\n\n5. Set your feet\n   Rear foot behind, front foot slightly open. If possible, prepare a scissor jump (rear→front) to transfer weight forward.\n\n6. Start the swing from the body\n   Uncoil hips and shoulders first, then the elbow comes forward. Keep wrist relaxed—don’t “push” with a straight arm.\n\n7. Contact point\n   Reach fully and strike the shuttle **slightly in front** of your body at your highest comfortable point.\n\n8. Pronation & snap\n   At contact, rotate the forearm (pronation) and whip the wrist. Think “throwing” the racket head through the shuttle.\n\n9. Follow-through\n   Let the racket continue across your body naturally; don’t stop it short. This preserves power and protects your shoulder.\n\n10. Land & recover\n    Land in a scissor (rear foot forward), take a small hop, and return to base ready for the next shot.\n\nQuick tips\n\n* Aim steep and fast rather than only flat and hard.\n* Mix in drop shots and clears so opponents can’t camp on your smash.\n* Common mistakes: panhandle grip, contacting too far back, swinging only with the arm, and failing to recover.\n\nIf you’d like, I can also provide a short practice plan (shadow swings → multi-shuttle → target cones) to help you master it.\n",

    "question": "How to do a bench press? Show visual steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Begin by lying flat on the bench, with your body in a natural and relaxed position. Make sure that you are not holding your shoulders in an awkward position. Be sure to have a natural spinal curve. You do not want to have your lower back flat on the bench, but you do not want to force it to curve too much either. Instead, opt for a comfortable and natural position. You should have your feet flat on the ground, shoulder-width apart, and your shoulders touching the bench. Do not lift on a \"cushiony bench\" if you are a heavy lifter. When the bar and plates weigh more than 200 pounds plus the weight of your upper body, your shoulders will disappear into the bench and cause neck strain. Choose a proper bench that fits your shoulder width. A narrow bench is unstable and a wide bench prevents the upper arm from bending back. 2. Put your arms straight out to either side of you, and then bend your elbows, bringing your hands up to touch the bar. This is where you should position your hands. They should be about shoulder-width apart. Use the smooth rings in the bar as a reference for even hand placement. Where you position your hands will affect which muscle group you work most. Widen your grip slightly to increase the amount of pectoral muscles involved in this exercise, and bring your grip in slightly to increase your triceps involvement. For a standard bench press, opt for the normal grip. 3. Begin with just the bar weight to warm up before heavy lifting. Lift the bar off the rack and position it directly above the middle of your chest. Inhale as you lower it down, gently touching your chest — the middle of the sternum — with the bar. Do not bounce the bar off your chest, as this can cause serious injury and promotes bad form . Begin to exhale as you push the bar up and away from your body. Extend your arms to just under full extension. Repeat this for eight repetitions as your first set. Lift with a bar that has a little flex but is not \"whippy\". A stiff bar can be uncomfortable to lift with. All bars are made of metal and relatively stiff, but a bar with some flex feels better on the joints. The salesperson at the store will give you the right bar for your bodyweight, based on the formula for bodyweight and bench press. Generally, a beginning or intermediate lifter is not going to lift over his bodyweight plus 50%. Examine your goals when choosing a bar. For setting a personal record or a state record and above, use a bar with a standard diameter of 1 1 ⁄ 16 inches (2.7 cm). If not concerned with records, a thicker bar does not dig into the palms and is more comfortable. A thicker bar increases the distance of the lift and decreases the amount that can be lifted. A 1/8 (or 1/16) inch increase in bar diameter has a noticeable difference in feel and stability. 4. Rack the bar and add weight. Always use weight clips to prevent the weights from sliding off the bar in the event that you lift unevenly, do not lift without them. The bar by itself weighs 45 pounds. You will want to increase by five to ten pounds at a time until you find a comfortable weight. Practice extra caution if tall. Tall lifters with wide grips should use care not to crush their hands when racking the bar. Weight benches were made for someone tall (6 feet tall and not for a lifter 6 feet 8 inches tall). Tall lifters should not use an extra wide grip. An extra wide grip strains the wrist with excessive radial flexion. Close and wide grips can make the wrist more prone to injury. Avoid using the thumbless grip. If the bar slips off your hands, it would be disastrous. When being spotted by spotters and by a spotting device the thumbless grip is not as dangerous, but the spotting device has to be very, very solid. The thumbless grips is easier on the wrist and conducts power to the bar more directly (you can lift more). Use chalk with both grips. There are lifters who will use the thumbless grips despite the possible danger. 5. Be sure to have a spotter to help you whenever you lift a heavy weight. You never want to drop the bar on yourself. You also want to be able to max out and be able to recover when you no longer can lift the bar. A spotter will be able to help you recover from your final press. 6. Lift the bar up, slowly bring it down to just above your sternum, and explode upward for one rep. Pay attention to your form as you add more weight. It's easier to bend your wrists, bounce the weight off your chest, and exhibit other \"no-nos\" when trying to lift big. You'll gain more muscle and strength lifting the right form and lower weight than you will lifting with higher weight and the wrong form. Lifters generally do between 8 and 12 reps (also called \"repetitions\") and 3 to six sets (one set is the maximum numbers of reps you give yourself). 7. Drink plenty of water and take at least two minute breaks between each set. Water will help you stay hydrated and allow your muscles to function at high capacity, giving you an overall better workout. 8. Rest according to how you feel between sets. Some guides say the ideal rest time between sets is 90 to 120 seconds. While this is perhaps a good general guide for increasing muscle mass, it may not be ideal for you as an individual. You probably don't want to overshoot the 2-3 minute range, but you don't want to rush yourself into lifting thin. If your ultimate goal is gaining muscle and mass, you're going to want to shock your body. How you do this is up to you. It can mean cutting down on rest time, increasing poundage on lifts, supersetting, etc. As long as you manage to keep pushing your body physically, you will notice a difference.",

When tectonic forces push, pull, or shear the crust, stress builds along the fault.\n\nHow faults cause earthquakes (the stick-slip cycle):\n1.\tLocked: Rough fault surfaces “stick” due to friction while plate motion keeps stressing them.\n2.\tStrain builds: Rock around the fault elastically bends and stores energy.\n3.\tRupture: When stress exceeds frictional strength, the fault suddenly slips. The break starts at the hypocenter (focus) at depth and spreads along the fault.\n4.\tSeismic waves: Stored elastic energy radiates as P and S waves that shake the ground. The point on the surface above the focus is the epicenter.\n5.\tAftershocks: The crust adjusts to the new positions, producing smaller quakes on or near the same fault.\n\nMain fault types & the stresses that create them:\n•\tNormal fault (tension/extension): Crust is pulled apart; the hanging wall moves down.\n•\tReverse/thrust fault (compression): Crust is squeezed; the hanging wall moves up (common in subduction zones and mountain belts).\n•\tStrike-slip fault (shear): Blocks slide horizontally past each other (e.g., transform boundaries); motion can be right-lateral or left-lateral.\n\nWhy some places shake more:\nMost large earthquakes occur at plate boundaries where stress accumulates fastest: subduction zones (big thrust quakes), continental collisions (reverse faults), and major transforms (strike-slip).\n\nImage generated separately above: labeled diagram showing a fault plane, the earthquake cycle with hypocenter/epicenter and waves, plus normal/reverse/strike-slip fault insets.",

Each input token is first converted into a dense vector through embedding, combined with positional encodings to maintain word order.

Now, let me break it down for you.\n\nBERT is built entirely on the encoder stack of the Transformer architecture. Unlike models like GPT, which use a decoder, BERT uses only the encoder part. The structure starts with input embeddings, where the input tokens are first converted into vectors. These embeddings are then passed through a series of encoder layers (12 in the base version of BERT). Each encoder layer consists of multi-head self-attention and feedforward neural networks that allow the model to understand the contextual relationships between words in a sentence.\n\nThis encoder-only setup allows BERT to effectively understand bidirectional context, meaning it can look at the words on both sides of a token during training, unlike traditional unidirectional models. This is what makes BERT so powerful for tasks like question answering and sentence classification.\n",

Doing so opens a list of all apps that currently support notifications. 3. Scroll down and tap Instagram . Apps here are listed alphabetically, so you'll find Instagram in the \"I\" section. If Instagram is not appearing, you may need to wait until you've received a notification from someone. If Instagram is still not appearing in the list, even after receiving a notification in the app, uninstall the Instagram app, restart your phone, and then install it again. When you launch the reinstalled app, select Allow Notifications when prompted, and Instagram should appear in the Notifications section of the Settings app. 4. Tap the white \"Allow Notifications\" switch . It's at the top of the screen. Tapping it will cause it to turn green , signifying that Instagram will send notifications to your iPhone. If you want to disable Instagram notifications completely, tap the green \"Allow Notifications\" switch and then skip the rest of this method. 5. Enable or disable other notifications. Tap the white switch to the right of each of the following options to enable them, or tap the green switch next to each of them to disable them: Sounds - Turn on or off Instagram sounds. Badge App Icon - Turn on or off Instagram badge icons, which are the numbers that display in the corner of the Instagram app when you have pending notifications. Show on Lock Screen - Turn on or off notifications that appear on your iPhone's Lock Screen. Show in History - Turn on or off notifications history for Instagram. Notifications history can be checked by swiping down from the top of the screen. Show as Banners - Turn on or off banner-style notifications, which display at the top of the screen when your iPhone is unlocked. 6. Select an alert style. Below the \"Show as Banners\" switch, tap either Temporary or Persistent . This option won't display if you have \"Show as Banners\" turned off. \"Temporary\" alerts appear briefly at the top of your iPhone's screen before disappearing, while \"Persistent\" alerts don't disappear until you swipe them away. 7. Set a preview option. This will determine whether or not you can see the content of an Instagram notification without opening it. Scroll down and tap Show Previews , then select one of the following options: Always (Default) - You will always see previews for Instagram notifications (e.g., \"Sarah liked your post\"). When Unlocked - You will see previews for Instagram notifications when your iPhone is unlocked. Never - You will never see previews for Instagram notifications. 8. Tap the \"Back\" button twice. It's in the top-left corner of the screen. This will take you back to the Notifications page, saving your changes in the process. Instagram will now send you notifications.",
