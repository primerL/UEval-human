Draw a curve above each eye with an oval in the middle. 3. 3. Add a line underneath the nose, then sketch a hook shape on either side. 4. 4. Draw a curve underneath the cartoon puppy face's mouth. 5. 5. Sketch a curve on either side of the face. 6. 6. Draw a rectangle with rounded edges to outline the head. 7. 7. Outline an oval for the right ear. Make sure the oval is behind the face. 8. 8. Repeat the previous step for the left ear. 9. 9. Use a wavy shape to draw a patch around your puppy face's eye. Finally, outline your easy dog face with black. Use thick lines for most of the drawing and a thin line for the patch. If you like, add a dog biscuit to give your dog a treat. 10. You can fill in your easy dog face with any color, but this guide recommends using tan for the face and dark brown for the ears, nose and patch. Leave the eyes white, and add a white highlight to the nose.",

Clean outline\n   Trace the circle cleanly (keep guidelines faint so you can erase them later).\n\n3. Eyes\n   Place two big oval eyes on the horizontal guideline, spaced about one eye-width apart. Add tiny highlights (white dots) to make them lively.\n\n4. Nose & muzzle\n   Under the eye line, draw a small upside-down triangle nose. From the sides of the nose, curve two lines down and around to form a soft “W” for the cheeks and a small smile. Add a little tongue if you like.\n\n5. Ears\n   Add two floppy, rounded triangle ears attached near the top sides of the head.\n\n6. Details\n   Add short eyebrow curves above the eyes, a small chin line, and three tiny whisker dots on each cheek (optional).\n\n7. Refine the smile\n   Thicken the mouth line slightly and round the cheeks so it looks friendly. Erase the guidelines.\n\n8. Finish\n   Add a collar and tag under the chin if desired. You can also add a patch around one eye or a few spots. Ink your final lines and color if you want.\n\nTips:\n\n* Keep everything round and soft for a cute look.\n* If you want a different breed vibe, change the ear shape (pointy for a husky, long and thin for a hound).\n* Eyes higher = younger/cuter; eyes lower = older/goofier.\n\nIf you want, I can also make a printable worksheet version.\n",

    "reference_text": "1. 1. Begin the owl babies outline by drawing the bird’s huge, round eyes. First, outline two circles. Use two curved lines that don’t quite meet to draw each. Then, shade a large round pupil inside each eye. Between them, draw an inverted teardrop shape. This is the owlet’s beak. Draw two short lines inside it to form the nostrils. Next, draw the fluffy feathers on top of the animal’s head. Use a series of short, curved lines that meet at jagged points. 2. 2. Draw a series of short, curved, connected lines above each eye. Use a similar series of lines - short ones that meet at gentle points - to outline the round, feathered face. Then, draw a series of lines that meet at points to outline the side of its round body. 3. 3. Use a series of curved lines that meet at jagged points to draw the opposite side of the baby’s body. Draw the owl’s legs, using long lines for the outsides, and connect them with a series of short lines. 4. 4. Texture the feathers of the owl’s chest using a series of short curved lines. Then, draw the bird’s foot. Draw three teardrop-shaped claws. Draw “U” shaped lines passing behind them to form the toes. 5. 5. Draw the owl’s remaining foot. Again, draw three teardrop-shaped claws with “U” shaped lines passing behind them to form the toes. Then, begin the second owlet. Draw the eyes, using two curved lines that don’t quite meet to draw each. Shade a large round pupil inside each eye. Draw a curved triangle between the eyes, forming the beak. 6. 6. Outline the feathery head using a series of short curved lines that meet at jagged points. Draw similar lines above the eyes. Draw a small nostril within the beak. 7. 7. Use a series of short, curved, jagged lines to draw the wing, and another for the belly. 8. 8. Draw the second owl’s feet. First, draw teardrop shapes for the six talons. Then, use curved lines to sketch the toes. 9. 9. Texture each owlet’s feathers with individual curved lines and connected lines in series. Notice the bellies, the base of the neck, and the area around the beak. 10. Your owl babies outline is now complete. Color your picture. Different species of owl have different feather colors, but they range from brown to gray.",

Keep them symmetrical.\n\n4. **Pupils & highlights**\n   Inside each eye, draw a smaller circle for the iris/pupil. Add a tiny white highlight circle so the eyes look lively.\n\n5. **Beak**\n   Between the eyes on the center line, draw a small diamond/triangle pointing down.\n\n6. **Wings**\n   On each side of the body, draw a long curved “(” and “)” shape for wings that stop above the feet area.\n\n7. **Belly patch & feather marks**\n   Draw a rounded oval on the belly. Add 2–3 rows of small “~” or “U” shapes for feathers.\n\n8. **Feet (and a branch, optional)**\n   Two stubby feet made of three rounded toes each (like a soft “W”). If you want, place them on a simple branch.\n\n9. **Clean line art**\n   Trace your favorite lines with a darker pen/marker. Erase all construction lines and overlaps.\n\n10. **Color**\n    Body: light–medium brown. Wings: darker brown. Belly: cream. Beak/feet: yellow-orange. Add a leaf on the branch for a pop of green.\n\n**Quick tips**\n\n* Keep lines light until the clean-up step.\n* If the owl looks grumpy, lift the inner top curves of the eyes a touch.\n* Big eyes and a small beak = cuter style.\n",

    "reference_text": "1. Fill a large pot about 2/3 full of water. Since the pasta needs lots of room to move around as it cooks, use a big pot. For example, if you'll be cooking a 1 pound (450 g) box of pasta, get out a pot that's at least 4 US quarts (3.8 L) in size. Then, pour in enough water to come 2/3 up the side of the pot. If you use a pot that's too small, your pasta is more likely to clump together as it cooks. 2. Cover the pot and bring the water to a boil. Set the pot of water on the stove and put a lid on it. Turn the burner to high and let the water come to a boil. You'll know the water is boiling when you see steam escaping from under the lid. Covering the pot with a lid will make the water boil faster. 3. Add salt and 1 pound (450 g) of pasta to the boiling water. Once the water boils vigorously, remove the lid and add 1 tablespoon (17 g) of salt and 1 pound (450 g) of pasta. If you're cooking long noodles, such as spaghetti, that don't fit in the pot, wait about 30 seconds and then push them into the water using a spoon or pasta fork. The salt will season the noodles as they cook, which will give you flavorful pasta. If you're unsure how many servings of pasta to cook, check the side of the box for recommended serving sizes. 4. Set a timer for 3 to 8 minutes. Stir the noodles with a pasta fork to break the noodles up and leave the lid off the pot. Then, check the pasta package for a recommended cooking time and set a timer for the minimum time that's suggested. For example, if the box says to cook the noodles for 7 to 9 minutes, set a timer for 7 minutes. Thin pasta, such as angel hair, will cook faster than thick or long noodles, such as fettuccine or penne, which take closer to 8 or 9 minutes. 5. Stir the noodles occasionally as they boil. The water should continue to bubble as the pasta cooks. Stir it every few minutes to prevent the noodles from sticking together. If the water looks like it might boil over the sides of the pot, turn the burner down to medium-high. 6. Bite into a noodle to see if it's cooked enough for you. Carefully scoop a noodle out of the water when the timer beeps and set it aside to cool a little. Bite into the noodle to tell if it's still hard in the center or if it's as soft as you like. Most people prefer to cook pasta until it's al dente, which means it's still a little firm in the center. If the pasta is still too hard for your liking, boil it for another minute before checking it again.",

    "generated_text": "Here’s your **text guide**. The **visual guide** is attached above as an infographic.\n\n# Text Guide: How to Boil Pasta Perfectly\n\n1. Pick the pot + water\n\n* Use a big pot so pasta can move freely.\n* Water: **4–6 quarts (4–5.5 L) per 1 lb / 450 g** pasta.\n\n2. Salt like the sea\n\n* Add salt once the water is hot but before the pasta goes in.\n* Aim for **1–2% salinity** (about **1½–2 Tbsp kosher salt** or **1 Tbsp table salt** per 4–6 quarts). This seasons the pasta itself.\n\n3. Rolling boil first\n\n* Wait for a **vigorous, rolling boil (100°C / 212°F)** before adding pasta. Lids help you get there; remove the lid once boiling.\n\n4. Add pasta & stir early\n\n* Drop pasta in and **stir for the first 1–2 minutes** to prevent sticking, then stir occasionally.\n\n5. Cook to al dente (taste, don’t guess)\n\n* Start tasting **2 minutes before** the package’s low end.\n* Al dente = cooked through with a pleasant bite and no chalky center.\n\n6. Save some pasta water\n\n* **Reserve ½–1 cup** starchy water before draining. It helps sauces cling and lets you adjust thickness.\n\n7. Drain, don’t rinse\n\n* **Do not rinse** (you’ll wash off starch). Only rinse if making a **cold pasta salad**.\n\n8. Marry pasta with sauce\n\n* Finish pasta **in a pan with the sauce** for 1–2 minutes, loosening with splashes of reserved water and finishing with a knob of butter or olive oil if desired. Season to taste.\n\n9. Rest & serve hot\n\n* Let it sit **30–60 seconds** off heat to settle the sauce; plate immediately.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Timing Reference (start tasting early!)\n\n* **Fresh pasta (eggs)**: 2–4 min\n* **Dry thin long (spaghetti, linguine)**: 8–10 min\n* **Dry short (penne, rigatoni, fusilli)**: 9–12 min\n* **Thick/shape with ridges or whole wheat**: 11–13+ min\n* **Gluten-free**: often **less forgiving**—taste frequently in the last few minutes.\n\n---\n\n## Common Mistakes & Fixes\n\n* **Pot too small** → water cools off and pasta sticks. Use a larger pot.\n* **Under-salting** → flat flavor. Salt the water properly.\n* **Adding pasta before a full boil** → gummy texture. Wait for the rolling boil.\n* **Not stirring early** → clumps. Stir in the first 1–2 minutes.\n* **Overcooking** → mush. Taste early and often.\n* **Rinsing after draining** → sauce won’t cling. Don’t rinse unless for cold dishes.\n\n---\n\n## Pro Tips\n\n* For silky sauces, emulsify: **toss pasta + sauce + reserved water** over medium heat until glossy.\n* Cooking for later? **Undercook by ~1 minute**, then finish in sauce when reheating.\n* High altitude: water boils at a lower temp—**add a minute or two** and rely on tasting.\n\nIf you want, I can tailor the infographic for a specific pasta shape or serving size.\n",

    "question": "How to clean a cutting board? Provide steps with visuals and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Rinse your board right after using it. Rinse your board with water right after you use it, rather than waiting until the end of the meal or even the next day when you clean it. This will help minimize bacteria growth and keep your board cleaner. Resist the urge to throw your board in the sink after the meal and forget about it. 2. Clean your board with dish soap and hot water. To clean your cutting board, scrub it with a few drops of dish soap on a sponge and some hot water. [2] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview Be sure to remove any food particles as you wash, paying particular attention to any grooves or scrapes in your board. Food can collect in these spots. Never clean a wooden cutting board in the dishwasher or soak it in water. The wood will absorb water, which can lead to bacteria and mold forming. [4] X Expert Source James Sears House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview 3. Rinse your board. Rinse your board to remove any traces of soap. You don’t want whatever you cook next to taste like your dish soap. [5] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview 4. Dry your board thoroughly to prevent cracking. After you’re finished washing your cutting board, dry it thoroughly with a clean dishtowel, removing any excess water. This is particularly important if your board is made of wood, as they are more prone to cracks. 5. Use a combination of white vinegar and baking soda. To sanitize your cutting board after use, sprinkle it with some baking soda. Then, spray the baking soda–covered board with white vinegar. This will fizz, helping draw stains out of your board and deodorizing it. Let this mix sit for 5 minutes and then rinse your board with water, drying as normal. 6. Disinfect your board with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Just as hydrogen peroxide can clean a wound, it can also clean your cutting board. Sprinkle your board with 3% hydrogen peroxide solution, and let it stand for 1 minute to kill any surface bacteria. Then, rinse your board with water, and dry with a dishtowel as normal. [8] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview Hydrogen peroxide can bleach porous surfaces like wood. Don’t let the solution sit too long or it might fade your cutting board. 7. Remove stains with a scrub of coarse salt. For deep, set-in stains on your cutting board, use a coarse salt, such as kosher salt, as a scrub. [10] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview Wet a sponge and use a handful of salt to scour your board, focusing on any areas of discoloration. Rinse your board with water when finished, and dry with a clean towel. [11] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview Be sure to wash your hands well and moisturize them with lotion after scrubbing your board with salt. It can be very drying. Another option is wearing kitchen gloves. 8. Wash your board with diluted bleach once a month. Especially if you work with raw meats and fish on your cutting board, use a diluted bleach solution to do a deep clean of your board once a month. Make a solution that’s 1/8th bleach and 7/8ths water. Wet a sponge, and scrub your board with the solution. Rinse well with plain water and dry your board as normal with a clean towel. 9. Rub your board with a lemon to deodorize once a week. To keep your board smelling fresh, use half of a cut lemon to deodorize your board. Rub the cut-side of the lemon along the length of the board side to side. Then, rinse with plain water, and dry with a clean towel. 10. Condition your cutting board weekly. If your cutting board is made of wood, use mineral oil to condition your board after it’s clean. This will keep it in optimal condition. Do not use organic oils or fats, which can turn rancid, to lubricate your board. Look for products labeled kitchen-grade white mineral oil, such as Howard’s Cutting Board Oil. There are other mineral oils meant for lubricating machinery but not for consumption. Look specifically for kitchen-grade oil. You can condition your board every time you clean it, or a minimum of once a week. Simply rub your board with the conditioner, and let it air try so the oil can soak in.",

Place a damp towel under the board so it won’t slip.\n\n2. **Remove crown & base**\n\n* Lay the pineapple on its side. Slice off about ½ inch from the top (crown) and bottom to make flat ends.\n\n3. **Stand and peel**\n\n* Stand it upright. Following the curve of the fruit, slice downward in long strips to remove the skin. Keep cuts shallow to save fruit.\n\n4. **Remove the “eyes”**\n\n* You’ll see brown “eyes” left in diagonal rows. Make shallow V-shaped notches along those diagonals (or shave them off) until the flesh is clean.\n\n5. **Choose your cut**\n\n* **Method A — Rings:** Lay the pineapple on its side and slice crosswise into ½-inch discs. Use a small round cutter or a paring knife to remove the hard core circle from each disc.\n* **Method B — Spears & Chunks:** Stand it up. Cut in half lengthwise, then into quarters. Lay each quarter flat and slice off the tough core (a pale, fibrous triangle) from the center edge. Cut quarters into long spears, then into bite-size chunks.\n\n6. **Serve or store**\n\n* Eat right away, or refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 3–4 days. For longer storage, freeze chunks on a tray, then bag.\n\n**Tips**\n\n* A ripe pineapple smells sweet at the base and yields slightly when pressed.\n* For cleaner cuts, wipe juice from the board as you go.\n* Try a sprinkle of lime and chili powder, or grill spears 1–2 minutes per side for caramelization.\n\n(Visual guide generated separately above.)\n",

It was always accessible for maintenance and intentionally shaped to be navigable.\n* **Functional sculptures:** The helmet-like “warriors” are chimney stacks and ventilation towers; their sculptural forms also help manage wind and prevent back-drafts and rain ingress—so they’re both art and infrastructure.\n* **Structural logic below:** The varying roof levels follow the catenary-arch attic structure underneath, creating hills and dips that turn the roof into a walkable topography.\n* **Open to visitors today:** Railings, marked routes, and staffed entry make the space safely accessible as part of the La Pedrera museum experience, so visitors can explore the architecture and the city views.\n",

    "generated_text": "Explanation (why people can walk along the roof of the O2 Arena):\n • Dedicated roof-walk, not the roof fabric itself. The public route—marketed as “Up at The O2”—is a purpose-built, slightly springy tensile walkway laid over the dome. Visitors step on this walkway, not on the delicate membrane roof.\n • Supported by the arena’s structural skeleton. The walkway is cable-hung and bracketed back to the O2’s primary structure (the steel perimeter ring, radial cables, and the iconic yellow masts). This means the loads from groups of people are carried by the steelwork and cables designed to handle them.\n • Non-slip, flexible deck. The deck uses a high-friction, weather-resistant surface with just enough give to accommodate the dome’s curvature and wind movements without damaging the underlying roof.\n • Continuous fall-arrest system. Each climber wears a harness clipped to a continuous safety rail along the route, with handlines and occasional steps at steeper sections—so people remain secured the entire time.\n • Controlled capacity and guided access. Group sizes, pacing, and weather checks are managed by guides, keeping live loads within the design limits and ensuring safe operation.\n\nIn short, a separate, engineered walkway—suspended and anchored to the O2’s main steel-and-cable frame—plus a clip-in safety system makes it possible for visitors to walk over the dome safely.",

    "question": "How to Do a Layup in Basketball? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Dribble close to the basket with your right hand. Since you're doing a right-handed layup, angle your approach toward the right side of the basket. You want to get close enough to have easy access to the basket, but not so close that you end up directly under it. Layups are often taken off of a running dribble. Practice approaching the basket slowly at first, and increase your speed once you've got the footwork down. You can do a right-handed layup if you're starting near the center or right side of the basket. If you're approaching the basket from the left, you'll want to do a left-handed layup. 2. Step toward the basket with your right foot. When you're just a few feet from the basket, take a step toward it with our right foot. Use this step to gain distance and position yourself within easy shooting range. Dribble the ball one last time just outside your right foot. 3. Jump off of your left foot. As soon as your left foot lands, use it to jump in the direction of the basket. Your body should be moving toward the basket, but don't lean forward. Ideally, you'll be positioned close enough to the basket that you can jump straight up to take your shot. As you jump, bring the ball out of the dribble to your chest to prepare for the shot. 4. Shoot with your right arm as you lift your right leg. As you jump, imagine a string attached to your right arm and your right leg. Move them at the same time as you shoot, as though someone were pulling upward on the string. Your right knee should be bent and pointed toward the basket while your right arm moves up to shoot the ball. Arch your arm toward the basket. Shoot with your elbow slightly bent, so that your arm looks like the neck of a swan. When you're doing a layup, the shooting technique is slightly different from that of a regular shot. Instead of using your left hand to steady the ball, you want to shoot the ball using only your right hand. This gives you more reach, and since you're so close to the basket that it's difficult to miss the shot, you don't really need your left hand to steady the ball. As you shoot, slightly rotate your wrist inward to give the ball a little bit of spin, rather than snapping your wrist forward as you would for a regular shot. The gentle spin will keep it from hammering off the rim or backboard with too much force. 5. Aim for the sweet spot on the backboard. One of the reasons a layup is such a sure bet is because you can always use the backboard to help ease the shot into the basket. When you're doing a right-handed layup, the sweet spot is slightly above the top right corner of the small square in the center of the backboard. This spot absorbs the impact of the ball and drops it right down through the net. You'll get two points no matter how you make your shot, but it's better to aim for the backboard instead of trying to just tip the ball over the rim. The backboard allows more room for error, but if you hit the rim funny the ball will bounce right out. There's nothing worse than missing a wide-open layup when you have full access to the basket, so work on hitting that sweet spot every time. 6. Practice until your muscles remember the movement. The layup is a fundamental basketball move that will become second nature after you practice it enough. You should get to the point where your body remembers what to do and you don't have to think about which foot to put forward and which one to jump off: you just do it. Do layups as part of every basketball practice . As you practice, you'll start to get a good sense for how fast to approach the basket and from what distance to begin your layup footwork and launch into a jump. Work on doing layups while you're being defended or off of a long pass.",

This slows the escape of heat to space and **warms the lower atmosphere and surface** until a balance is reached between incoming sunlight and outgoing infrared.\n\n**Without the natural greenhouse effect,** Earth’s average surface temperature would be about **−18 °C (0 °F)**.\n**With it,** the average is about **+15 °C (59 °F)** — warm enough for **liquid water, stable climates, and the ecosystems and agriculture** life depends on.\n\n> Note: Adding extra greenhouse gases (e.g., rising CO₂ and CH₄) **enhances** the effect, shifting the balance and driving **modern climate change**.\n\n---\n\n**Image:** A labeled infographic illustrating the steps above (Sunlight in, reflection, surface warming, infrared out, greenhouse gases re-emitting heat, and the −18 °C vs +15 °C note).",

As we breathe, oxygen enters the nose or mouth and passes the sinuses, which are hollow spaces in the skull. Sinuses help regulate the temperature and humidity of the air we breathe. The trachea, also called the windpipe, filters the air that is inhaled, according to the American Lung Association. It branches into the bronchi, which are two tubes that carry air into each lung. The bronchial tubes are lined with tiny hairs called cilia. Cilia move back and forth, carrying mucus up and out. Mucus, a sticky fluid, collects dust, germs and other matter that has invaded the lungs. We expel mucus when we sneeze, cough, spit or swallow.",

This is the **mucociliary escalator**.\n\n**3) What happens to the trapped stuff.**\n\n* When the mucus reaches the throat, you **swallow** it. Stomach acid and enzymes break down most contaminants.\n* If there’s a lot of irritation, sensors trigger a **cough or sneeze**, which blasts mucus and particles out.\n\n**4) Deep areas without cilia: the alveoli.**\n\n* The tiny air sacs (alveoli) handle gas exchange and **don’t have cilia**.\n* Here, roaming **alveolar macrophages** (patrolling immune cells) **eat** fine particles and microbes.\n* What they collect is carried away via the mucociliary escalator (after they crawl to ciliated regions) or through **lymphatic drainage**.\n\n**5) Size matters (where particles tend to land).**\n\n* **Large** (> ~10 μm): mostly stopped in the **nose/throat**.\n* **Medium** (~2.5–10 μm): settle in the **trachea/bronchi**, cleared by cilia.\n* **Fine** (< ~2.5 μm): can reach the **alveoli**, handled by macrophages.\n* **Gases/ultrafine** may be absorbed or exhaled.\n\n**6) When the system struggles.**\n\n* **Dry air, dehydration, smoking, or pollutants** can thicken or paralyze mucus/cilia.\n* Certain conditions (e.g., **asthma**, **chronic bronchitis**, **cystic fibrosis**, or **primary ciliary dyskinesia**) reduce clearance, so particles linger and infections are more likely.\n\n**Quick recap:** your airways trap particles in mucus, **cilia sweep** that mucus upward, and **cough/sneeze or swallowing** removes it; deep in the lungs, **macrophages** finish the cleanup.\n\nIf you’d like, I can add labels or callouts to the diagram tailored to a specific class level (middle school vs. college).\n",

Often shows layers and may contain fossils.\n* **Metamorphic** – forms when any rock is **changed by heat and pressure** (without melting). Minerals **recrystallize** and may align into bands (e.g., slate, gneiss).\n\n## Main pathways (follow the arrows)\n\n1. **Magma → Igneous**: cooling & crystallization.\n2. **Igneous → Sediments**: uplift exposes rock; weathering breaks it down; erosion moves it.\n3. **Sediments → Sedimentary rock**: burial + compaction + cementation (lithification).\n4. **Sedimentary → Metamorphic**: deeper burial adds heat & pressure; minerals reorganize.\n5. **Metamorphic → Magma**: if heating goes far enough, the rock **melts**.\n6. **Shortcuts**:\n\n   * Any rock type can **weather & erode** back to **sediments**.\n   * **Igneous → Metamorphic** directly (heat & pressure).\n   * **Sedimentary → Magma** if it melts (usually via subduction).\n   * **Metamorphic → Sedimentary** if uplifted, weathered, and re-lithified.\n\n## What drives the cycle?\n\n* **Plate tectonics**: subduction drags rocks deep (heat, pressure, melting); collisions uplift mountains (exposure & weathering).\n* **Water, ice, wind**: power weathering & erosion at the surface.\n* **Heat from Earth’s interior**: fuels metamorphism and melting.\n\n## Quick ID tips\n\n* **Igneous**: interlocking crystals; sometimes glassy or with gas holes.\n* **Sedimentary**: visible grains or fossils; layered or crumbly cement.\n* **Metamorphic**: stretched/banded minerals; harder, denser versions of earlier rocks.\n\n## Big idea\n\nThe rock cycle isn’t a single loop—it’s a **network of paths**. Rocks can take many routes and spend millions of years in one stage before changing again.\n\nIf you want, I can label the diagram with a specific example path (e.g., “basalt → sand → sandstone → quartzite → magma”) or add classroom-ready annotations.\n",

The output is a dense **feature map**.\n\n2. **Region Proposal Network (RPN)** — the key piece\n\n* A small conv (typically **3×3**) slides over the feature map.\n* At each spatial location it places **k anchors** (default boxes at multiple scales/aspect ratios).\n* Two parallel 1×1 heads predict for every anchor:\n\n  * **Objectness score** (foreground vs background)\n  * **Box deltas** (tx, ty, tw, th) to refine the anchor.\n* Gather all anchors, apply **box decoding + clipping**, then **Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)** to keep the **top-N proposals** (e.g., \\~200–300 at test time).\n  **Purpose:** Replace slow hand-crafted proposal methods with a fast, learned, end-to-end generator of high-quality candidate regions.\n\n3. **RoI feature extraction**\n   Each proposal is projected back onto the backbone feature map and pooled to a fixed size (RoI Pool/Align).\n\n4. **Detection head**\n   Fully connected (or conv) layers output:\n\n* **Class probabilities** (including background)\n* **Per-class box refinements** (final bounding boxes)\n\n**Training note (brief):**\nRPN and detector share the backbone. A multitask loss (objectness + box regression for RPN; classification + box regression for the detector) enables joint, end-to-end learning.\n",
