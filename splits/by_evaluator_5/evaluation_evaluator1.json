Draw a curve above each eye with an oval in the middle. 3. 3. Add a line underneath the nose, then sketch a hook shape on either side. 4. 4. Draw a curve underneath the cartoon puppy face's mouth. 5. 5. Sketch a curve on either side of the face. 6. 6. Draw a rectangle with rounded edges to outline the head. 7. 7. Outline an oval for the right ear. Make sure the oval is behind the face. 8. 8. Repeat the previous step for the left ear. 9. 9. Use a wavy shape to draw a patch around your puppy face's eye. Finally, outline your easy dog face with black. Use thick lines for most of the drawing and a thin line for the patch. If you like, add a dog biscuit to give your dog a treat. 10. You can fill in your easy dog face with any color, but this guide recommends using tan for the face and dark brown for the ears, nose and patch. Leave the eyes white, and add a white highlight to the nose.",

Clean outline\n   Trace the circle cleanly (keep guidelines faint so you can erase them later).\n\n3. Eyes\n   Place two big oval eyes on the horizontal guideline, spaced about one eye-width apart. Add tiny highlights (white dots) to make them lively.\n\n4. Nose & muzzle\n   Under the eye line, draw a small upside-down triangle nose. From the sides of the nose, curve two lines down and around to form a soft “W” for the cheeks and a small smile. Add a little tongue if you like.\n\n5. Ears\n   Add two floppy, rounded triangle ears attached near the top sides of the head.\n\n6. Details\n   Add short eyebrow curves above the eyes, a small chin line, and three tiny whisker dots on each cheek (optional).\n\n7. Refine the smile\n   Thicken the mouth line slightly and round the cheeks so it looks friendly. Erase the guidelines.\n\n8. Finish\n   Add a collar and tag under the chin if desired. You can also add a patch around one eye or a few spots. Ink your final lines and color if you want.\n\nTips:\n\n* Keep everything round and soft for a cute look.\n* If you want a different breed vibe, change the ear shape (pointy for a husky, long and thin for a hound).\n* Eyes higher = younger/cuter; eyes lower = older/goofier.\n\nIf you want, I can also make a printable worksheet version.\n",

Then, shade a large round pupil inside each eye. Between them, draw an inverted teardrop shape. This is the owlet’s beak. Draw two short lines inside it to form the nostrils. Next, draw the fluffy feathers on top of the animal’s head. Use a series of short, curved lines that meet at jagged points. 2. 2. Draw a series of short, curved, connected lines above each eye. Use a similar series of lines - short ones that meet at gentle points - to outline the round, feathered face. Then, draw a series of lines that meet at points to outline the side of its round body. 3. 3. Use a series of curved lines that meet at jagged points to draw the opposite side of the baby’s body. Draw the owl’s legs, using long lines for the outsides, and connect them with a series of short lines. 4. 4. Texture the feathers of the owl’s chest using a series of short curved lines. Then, draw the bird’s foot. Draw three teardrop-shaped claws. Draw “U” shaped lines passing behind them to form the toes. 5. 5. Draw the owl’s remaining foot. Again, draw three teardrop-shaped claws with “U” shaped lines passing behind them to form the toes. Then, begin the second owlet. Draw the eyes, using two curved lines that don’t quite meet to draw each. Shade a large round pupil inside each eye. Draw a curved triangle between the eyes, forming the beak. 6. 6. Outline the feathery head using a series of short curved lines that meet at jagged points. Draw similar lines above the eyes. Draw a small nostril within the beak. 7. 7. Use a series of short, curved, jagged lines to draw the wing, and another for the belly. 8. 8. Draw the second owl’s feet. First, draw teardrop shapes for the six talons. Then, use curved lines to sketch the toes. 9. 9. Texture each owlet’s feathers with individual curved lines and connected lines in series. Notice the bellies, the base of the neck, and the area around the beak. 10. Your owl babies outline is now complete. Color your picture. Different species of owl have different feather colors, but they range from brown to gray.",

Then, draw two parallel curved lines entering the oval-shaped portion of the clasp. The lines will form a question mark shape. 9. 9. Use a curved line, doubled back on itself, to form the tip of the question mark shape. At its middle, enclose a bump - the movable arm of the clasp - using a curved line. At its base, draw a circle within a circle. Use another circle within a circle to form the chain link connecting it to the rest of the bracelet. 10. Your bracelet outline is now complete.

    "question": "How to boil pasta perfectly? Provide a visual guide and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Fill a large pot about 2/3 full of water. Since the pasta needs lots of room to move around as it cooks, use a big pot. For example, if you'll be cooking a 1 pound (450 g) box of pasta, get out a pot that's at least 4 US quarts (3.8 L) in size. Then, pour in enough water to come 2/3 up the side of the pot. If you use a pot that's too small, your pasta is more likely to clump together as it cooks. 2. Cover the pot and bring the water to a boil. Set the pot of water on the stove and put a lid on it. Turn the burner to high and let the water come to a boil. You'll know the water is boiling when you see steam escaping from under the lid. Covering the pot with a lid will make the water boil faster. 3. Add salt and 1 pound (450 g) of pasta to the boiling water. Once the water boils vigorously, remove the lid and add 1 tablespoon (17 g) of salt and 1 pound (450 g) of pasta. If you're cooking long noodles, such as spaghetti, that don't fit in the pot, wait about 30 seconds and then push them into the water using a spoon or pasta fork. The salt will season the noodles as they cook, which will give you flavorful pasta. If you're unsure how many servings of pasta to cook, check the side of the box for recommended serving sizes. 4. Set a timer for 3 to 8 minutes. Stir the noodles with a pasta fork to break the noodles up and leave the lid off the pot. Then, check the pasta package for a recommended cooking time and set a timer for the minimum time that's suggested. For example, if the box says to cook the noodles for 7 to 9 minutes, set a timer for 7 minutes. Thin pasta, such as angel hair, will cook faster than thick or long noodles, such as fettuccine or penne, which take closer to 8 or 9 minutes. 5. Stir the noodles occasionally as they boil. The water should continue to bubble as the pasta cooks. Stir it every few minutes to prevent the noodles from sticking together. If the water looks like it might boil over the sides of the pot, turn the burner down to medium-high. 6. Bite into a noodle to see if it's cooked enough for you. Carefully scoop a noodle out of the water when the timer beeps and set it aside to cool a little. Bite into the noodle to tell if it's still hard in the center or if it's as soft as you like. Most people prefer to cook pasta until it's al dente, which means it's still a little firm in the center.

    "generated_text": "Here’s your **text guide**. The **visual guide** is attached above as an infographic.\n\n# Text Guide: How to Boil Pasta Perfectly\n\n1. Pick the pot + water\n\n* Use a big pot so pasta can move freely.\n* Water: **4–6 quarts (4–5.5 L) per 1 lb / 450 g** pasta.\n\n2. Salt like the sea\n\n* Add salt once the water is hot but before the pasta goes in.\n* Aim for **1–2% salinity** (about **1½–2 Tbsp kosher salt** or **1 Tbsp table salt** per 4–6 quarts). This seasons the pasta itself.\n\n3. Rolling boil first\n\n* Wait for a **vigorous, rolling boil (100°C / 212°F)** before adding pasta. Lids help you get there; remove the lid once boiling.\n\n4. Add pasta & stir early\n\n* Drop pasta in and **stir for the first 1–2 minutes** to prevent sticking, then stir occasionally.\n\n5. Cook to al dente (taste, don’t guess)\n\n* Start tasting **2 minutes before** the package’s low end.\n* Al dente = cooked through with a pleasant bite and no chalky center.\n\n6. Save some pasta water\n\n* **Reserve ½–1 cup** starchy water before draining. It helps sauces cling and lets you adjust thickness.\n\n7. Drain, don’t rinse\n\n* **Do not rinse** (you’ll wash off starch). Only rinse if making a **cold pasta salad**.\n\n8. Marry pasta with sauce\n\n* Finish pasta **in a pan with the sauce** for 1–2 minutes, loosening with splashes of reserved water and finishing with a knob of butter or olive oil if desired. Season to taste.\n\n9. Rest & serve hot\n\n* Let it sit **30–60 seconds** off heat to settle the sauce; plate immediately.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Timing Reference (start tasting early!)\n\n* **Fresh pasta (eggs)**: 2–4 min\n* **Dry thin long (spaghetti, linguine)**: 8–10 min\n* **Dry short (penne, rigatoni, fusilli)**: 9–12 min\n* **Thick/shape with ridges or whole wheat**: 11–13+ min\n* **Gluten-free**: often **less forgiving**—taste frequently in the last few minutes.\n\n---\n\n## Common Mistakes & Fixes\n\n* **Pot too small** → water cools off and pasta sticks. Use a larger pot.\n* **Under-salting** → flat flavor. Salt the water properly.\n* **Adding pasta before a full boil** → gummy texture. Wait for the rolling boil.\n* **Not stirring early** → clumps. Stir in the first 1–2 minutes.\n* **Overcooking** → mush. Taste early and often.\n* **Rinsing after draining** → sauce won’t cling. Don’t rinse unless for cold dishes.\n\n---\n\n## Pro Tips\n\n* For silky sauces, emulsify: **toss pasta + sauce + reserved water** over medium heat until glossy.\n* Cooking for later? **Undercook by ~1 minute**, then finish in sauce when reheating.\n* High altitude: water boils at a lower temp—**add a minute or two** and rely on tasting.\n\nIf you want, I can tailor the infographic for a specific pasta shape or serving size.\n",

    "question": "How to clean a cutting board? Provide steps with visuals and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Rinse your board right after using it. Rinse your board with water right after you use it, rather than waiting until the end of the meal or even the next day when you clean it. This will help minimize bacteria growth and keep your board cleaner. Resist the urge to throw your board in the sink after the meal and forget about it. 2. Clean your board with dish soap and hot water. To clean your cutting board, scrub it with a few drops of dish soap on a sponge and some hot water. [2] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview Be sure to remove any food particles as you wash, paying particular attention to any grooves or scrapes in your board. Food can collect in these spots. Never clean a wooden cutting board in the dishwasher or soak it in water. The wood will absorb water, which can lead to bacteria and mold forming. [4] X Expert Source James Sears House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview 3. Rinse your board. Rinse your board to remove any traces of soap. You don’t want whatever you cook next to taste like your dish soap. [5] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview 4. Dry your board thoroughly to prevent cracking. After you’re finished washing your cutting board, dry it thoroughly with a clean dishtowel, removing any excess water. This is particularly important if your board is made of wood, as they are more prone to cracks. 5. Use a combination of white vinegar and baking soda. To sanitize your cutting board after use, sprinkle it with some baking soda. Then, spray the baking soda–covered board with white vinegar. This will fizz, helping draw stains out of your board and deodorizing it. Let this mix sit for 5 minutes and then rinse your board with water, drying as normal. 6. Disinfect your board with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Just as hydrogen peroxide can clean a wound, it can also clean your cutting board. Sprinkle your board with 3% hydrogen peroxide solution, and let it stand for 1 minute to kill any surface bacteria. Then, rinse your board with water, and dry with a dishtowel as normal. [8] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview Hydrogen peroxide can bleach porous surfaces like wood. Don’t let the solution sit too long or it might fade your cutting board. 7. Remove stains with a scrub of coarse salt. For deep, set-in stains on your cutting board, use a coarse salt, such as kosher salt, as a scrub. [10] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview Wet a sponge and use a handful of salt to scour your board, focusing on any areas of discoloration. Rinse your board with water when finished, and dry with a clean towel. [11] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview Be sure to wash your hands well and moisturize them with lotion after scrubbing your board with salt. It can be very drying. Another option is wearing kitchen gloves. 8. Wash your board with diluted bleach once a month. Especially if you work with raw meats and fish on your cutting board, use a diluted bleach solution to do a deep clean of your board once a month. Make a solution that’s 1/8th bleach and 7/8ths water. Wet a sponge, and scrub your board with the solution. Rinse well with plain water and dry your board as normal with a clean towel. 9. Rub your board with a lemon to deodorize once a week. To keep your board smelling fresh, use half of a cut lemon to deodorize your board. Rub the cut-side of the lemon along the length of the board side to side. Then, rinse with plain water, and dry with a clean towel. 10. Condition your cutting board weekly. If your cutting board is made of wood, use mineral oil to condition your board after it’s clean. This will keep it in optimal condition. Do not use organic oils or fats, which can turn rancid, to lubricate your board. Look for products labeled kitchen-grade white mineral oil, such as Howard’s Cutting Board Oil. There are other mineral oils meant for lubricating machinery but not for consumption. Look specifically for kitchen-grade oil. You can condition your board every time you clean it, or a minimum of once a week. Simply rub your board with the conditioner, and let it air try so the oil can soak in.",

Place a damp towel under the board so it won’t slip.\n\n2. **Remove crown & base**\n\n* Lay the pineapple on its side. Slice off about ½ inch from the top (crown) and bottom to make flat ends.\n\n3. **Stand and peel**\n\n* Stand it upright. Following the curve of the fruit, slice downward in long strips to remove the skin. Keep cuts shallow to save fruit.\n\n4. **Remove the “eyes”**\n\n* You’ll see brown “eyes” left in diagonal rows. Make shallow V-shaped notches along those diagonals (or shave them off) until the flesh is clean.\n\n5. **Choose your cut**\n\n* **Method A — Rings:** Lay the pineapple on its side and slice crosswise into ½-inch discs. Use a small round cutter or a paring knife to remove the hard core circle from each disc.\n* **Method B — Spears & Chunks:** Stand it up. Cut in half lengthwise, then into quarters. Lay each quarter flat and slice off the tough core (a pale, fibrous triangle) from the center edge. Cut quarters into long spears, then into bite-size chunks.\n\n6. **Serve or store**\n\n* Eat right away, or refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 3–4 days. For longer storage, freeze chunks on a tray, then bag.\n\n**Tips**\n\n* A ripe pineapple smells sweet at the base and yields slightly when pressed.\n* For cleaner cuts, wipe juice from the board as you go.\n* Try a sprinkle of lime and chili powder, or grill spears 1–2 minutes per side for caramelization.\n\n(Visual guide generated separately above.)\n",

Short cross-members link the pair of spirals at regular intervals—just like DNA’s “base pairs”—and lighting emphasizes the twist so the pattern reads clearly, especially at night.\n\nIt can still carry crowds safely because that DNA form isn’t just decoration; it’s a working spatial truss. Here’s how it holds up the deck:\n\n* Two opposite helices share the load. One spiral primarily takes compression in some segments while the other takes tension; together they brace each other against buckling and twisting.\n* Radial struts connect the deck to the helices, so the walkway’s weight (and people on it) is transferred into the surrounding tube network rather than a single beam.\n* The helical tubes form closed, triangulated paths for forces, which is very efficient. Loads flow through the tubes to a series of piers in the bay, so the bridge is supported in stages rather than by one long, bending span.\n* Stainless-steel tubes provide high strength relative to weight and resist corrosion in the marine environment, keeping the structure stiff and durable.\n* The geometry also resists side winds and footfall vibrations, and the deck has full-height guardrails and non-slip surfacing for safety.\n\nIn short: the bridge reads as DNA because its load-bearing skeleton is a pair of intertwined steel helices with “rungs”—the same elements that make it strong enough for pedestrians.\n\n(Generated photo provided above.)\n",

Keep gaze forward.\n\n3. **Press Up**\n\n* Drive the dumbbells **up and slightly back**, letting your head move a touch back so the bells travel close to your face.\n* Keep ribs from flaring; maintain tight glutes and abs.\n* Elbows stay under (or just in front of) the wrists—don’t let them flare wide.\n\n4. **Lockout**\n\n* Finish with arms straight, **biceps near ears**, shoulders down (no shrug).\n* Exhale at the top or through the sticking point. Pause briefly under control.\n\n5. **Lower**\n\n* Pull the weights back to shoulders on a controlled 2–3-second descent.\n* Keep torso tall; don’t lean back or arch.\n\n6. **Breathe & Repeat**\n\n* Reset your brace each rep. Perform 6–12 reps for hypertrophy or 3–6 for strength.\n* Stop 1–2 reps shy of form breakdown.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Tips\n\n* Start lighter than you think; build up in 2–5 lb jumps.\n* If your low back arches, **tighten abs and glutes** or switch to a half-kneeling stance.\n* Think “press the body **under** the bells” rather than pushing them far forward.\n\n### Common Mistakes → Fixes\n\n* **Flaring ribs / big back arch** → Squeeze glutes, exhale, knit ribs down.\n* **Bent-back wrists** → Stack knuckles over forearms; grip the handles firmly.\n* **Press path in front** → Aim slightly back at the top so bells finish over mid-foot.\n* **Shrugging** → Keep shoulder blades set down; don’t chase height with traps.\n\n### Variations\n\n* **Seated press** for more stability.\n* **Arnold press** for extra front-delt/rotation work.\n* **Single-arm press** to train anti-lean core control.\n\nStay smooth and pain-free—if you feel shoulder pinching, reduce range, rotate palms in, or stop.",

    "question": "How to Do Bicep Curls? Show visual steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Start small and work your way up the dumbbell scale as you progress. If you are new to doing curls, or simply looking to maintain existing muscle tone, even 1 to 3 lb (0.45 to 1.36 kg) weights may be sufficient. Taking on too much weight causes a breakdown in technique and can easily lead to injuries of the elbow, wrist, or muscle tissue. If you are going to do 2-handed curls with a bar, the same principle holds. Start at a lower weight and work your way up slowly. Everyone is different, so start with lighter weights and find the maximum amount that permits you to do your desired number of repetitions (reps) while retaining the proper form. 2. Adjust your regime to suit your goal. Generally speaking, if you are seeking to maintain existing muscle tone and arm strength, it is better to do more reps per set with a lower dumbbell weight. If you are looking to build muscle, do fewer reps at a higher weight (but again, don’t sacrifice technique). For muscle maintenance, do 1 to 3 sets of 10 to 12 reps each, for each arm. For strength building, sets of 6 to 8 reps may be preferable. Let your body be your guide. If you can’t do the number of reps you seek, reduce the dumbbell weight. If necessary, start with 1 set per arm and build up to 3. Reader Poll: We asked 649 wikiHow readers what type of exercise they enjoy most for arm workouts, and 72% of them said weightlifting. 3. Isolate your body movement so that only the arm doing the curl is moving. Traditional biceps curls are done while standing, but can also be done easily and properly while seated. Creating a solid base with your body positioning is critical to achieving this goal. Stand with your feet at hip width and your knees slightly bent. Keep your back straight and your abdomen pulled in (but not uncomfortably so). Let your arms rest at your sides and look forward—into a mirror, if possible, to monitor your technique. Sit with your feet firmly on the ground, your back straight and abdomen in, your arms to the side, and your head looking forward. Make sure the chair or bench will not impede your arm motion (or the dumbbell’s) during the curls. 4. Keep it smooth and simple. In spite of the form displayed by the aspiring Mr. Universe you might run into at the gym, a bicep curl shouldn’t be a quick, jerking motion that involves the entire body. It is meant to be a slow, steady, consistent motion that isolates a single muscle group. You can do dumbbell curls with both arms at the same time (or alternating arms), but for simplicity’s sake (especially as a beginner), you should probably start with 1 arm at a time. Or, you can do curls with both arms at the same time by using a bar. If so, you will use the same arm motions as described below for a dumbbell. With the dumbbell securely in your hand, palm facing forward and arm loose to your side, exhale and slowly bend your elbow and contract your biceps to draw the weight upward. While lifting, try to keep every other part of your body still. Keep raising the weight until it is at shoulder height, or even touching your shoulder. Pause for a beat without stopping to let the weight rest on your shoulder. Inhale and slowly lower the weight back to the starting position. Don’t let it just drop back down — control the movement in each direction. 5. Don’t cheat yourself. Sacrificing form to lift bigger dumbbells not only risks injury, it also minimizes the benefits of the curls. “Maxing out” on a curl should mean getting the most out of each one, not hurting yourself by flailing around with a giant dumbbell. Keep your wrists straight and rigid throughout the entire curl. It is easy to cause injury by using your wrist as a lever or letting it swing loosely. Use wrist wraps if they help. [9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Don’t lean forward to start the curl, and/or rock backward during the lift. Your body should not be acting as a pendulum during the curl — this takes the focus away from your biceps, and can cause a loss of balance and possible injury. Don’t let the weight rest on your shoulder at the top of the motion. If you need a break during a set, you are using too much weight or doing too many reps. Likewise, don’t rest your elbows on your hips or the sides of your abdomen during the motion. You want the full weight of the dumbbells to be isolated on your biceps. 6. Return and repeat. When you finish a curl, make sure you extend your arm fully — leaving your elbow slightly bent is another cheat that will reduce the impact of each curl. Once you’ve returned the dumbbell to the proper starting position, pause just long enough to refocus and exhale as you begin the next lift. Rest for 30 to 90 seconds between sets, if you are doing more than 1. If you're curling 1 arm at a time, keep alternating arms while allowing 1 to rest between its sets. Again, it is better to reduce the weight, or your reps or sets, than to let your form break down.",

Tighten your abs and push your lower back flat against the mat the entire time you’re performing crunches to ensure your core stays engaged. If you don’t have an exercise mat, then lay out a soft towel or do crunches on a carpeted floor so you’re more comfortable. 2. Bend your knees so your feet are flat on the floor. Position your feet so your heels are about 12 to 18 in (30 to 46 cm) from your tailbone. Bend your knees to 90 degrees and keep them about hip-width apart. Make sure the soles of your feet are flat against the ground. 3. Cross your arms in front of your chest with your hands just below your shoulders. Keep your elbows pointed down toward your feet. Lay your hands flat on your chest right in front of your shoulders. Avoid putting your hands behind your head since you could accidentally strain your neck when you perform your exercise. For more resistance during your workout, hold a 5 to 10 pounds (2.3 to 4.5 kg) plate weight over your chest. 4. Lift your shoulder blades off of the mat with a smooth, controlled motion. Tighten your abs and take a deep breath in. As you exhale, engage your muscles to raise your torso off of the mat all while keeping your lower back and feet flat on the floor. Lift yourself just enough to get your shoulder blades off of the floor. Support yourself in this position for 1–2 seconds. Avoid sitting all the way up when you perform a crunch since muscles in your back and hips will take over, and you could strain yourself. Keep your lower back, tailbone, and feet in contact with the mat at all times. If your feet lift off of the ground while you’re performing a rep, have someone hold onto your feet or position them underneath something heavy. Keep your neck relaxed instead of tucking in your chin. Try to keep an apple-sized space between your chin and your chest. Looking at the ceiling can help keep you from curling your neck too much. 5. Lower yourself back down with a slow, steady motion. Gently inhale as you slowly lower your torso down to the floor. Use a smooth, controlled motion to work your ab muscles and prevent you from injuring yourself. Take a brief pause to finish 1 rep. If you rush into the next rep, you’ll end up using the momentum of your body moving instead of your muscles to lift yourself up. Additionally, you’re more likely to injure your back Try doing a set of 10–12 crunches to start working out your abs . As you start building up your core strength, try doing 2–3 sets or increasing the number of reps you do.",

Because the rays are nearly parallel, the parabolic surface reflects them so they **converge toward a common focus**. This creates a **real, inverted image** at the **focal plane**.\n\n2. **Fold/redirect the beam**\n   To reach a convenient viewing or instrument position, a **secondary mirror** intercepts the converging beam and redirects it:\n\n   * **Newtonian**: a small **flat** mirror at ~45° sends the light out the side of the tube to a focuser.\n   * **Cassegrain**: a small **convex** mirror sends the light back through a hole in the primary to the rear of the telescope.\n\n3. **Viewing or recording the image**\n\n   * An **eyepiece** acts like a magnifying glass that views the real image at the focal plane, producing a magnified virtual image for your eye.\n   * A **camera sensor** can be placed at the focal plane to record the image directly (prime focus).\n\n4. **Key relationships**\n\n   * **Magnification** (for visual use): ( M \\approx \\dfrac{f_{\\text{telescope}}}{f_{\\text{eyepiece}}} ).\n   * **Angular resolution (diffraction limit)**: ( \\theta \\approx 1.22,\\dfrac{\\lambda}{D} ), so a **larger aperture (D)** resolves finer detail.\n   * **Light-gathering power** scales with **area** (\\propto D^2), so bigger mirrors reveal fainter objects.\n\n5. **Practical notes**\n\n   * The central obstruction (secondary mirror) and its support can slightly reduce contrast and create diffraction spikes on bright stars.\n   * Reflectors avoid chromatic aberration (since mirrors reflect all wavelengths the same), but they must be **collimated** (optics precisely aligned) to perform at their best.\n   * Image orientation isn’t “upright”—it may appear **rotated and/or mirrored** depending on the design and accessories, which is fine for astronomy.\n\nIf you’d like, I can also generate a second image showing the Cassegrain light path or label additional components (spider vanes, focuser, focal plane detail, etc.).\n",

This slows the escape of heat to space and **warms the lower atmosphere and surface** until a balance is reached between incoming sunlight and outgoing infrared.\n\n**Without the natural greenhouse effect,** Earth’s average surface temperature would be about **−18 °C (0 °F)**.\n**With it,** the average is about **+15 °C (59 °F)** — warm enough for **liquid water, stable climates, and the ecosystems and agriculture** life depends on.\n\n> Note: Adding extra greenhouse gases (e.g., rising CO₂ and CH₄) **enhances** the effect, shifting the balance and driving **modern climate change**.\n\n---\n\n**Image:** A labeled infographic illustrating the steps above (Sunlight in, reflection, surface warming, infrared out, greenhouse gases re-emitting heat, and the −18 °C vs +15 °C note).",

Light from the **illuminator** is focused through the specimen by the **condenser**. The **objective** forms a **real, inverted intermediate image** inside the tube; the **eyepiece** then magnifies that into the **virtual image** you see.\n\n**Total magnification = (eyepiece power) × (objective power).**\n**Resolution** (smallest detail you can separate) improves with higher **NA** of the objective/condenser and with shorter wavelengths of light.\n\n## What each numbered part does (match to the image)\n\n1. **Eyepiece (ocular)** – Magnifies the intermediate image made by the objective; often 10×. Some models include a **diopter** ring to match focus between your eyes.\n\n2. **Head / Body tube** – Holds the optics at fixed spacing so the objective image forms at the correct plane for the eyepiece.\n\n3. **Revolving nosepiece (turret)** – Clicks different **objective lenses** into the light path quickly.\n\n4. **Objectives (4×, 10×, 40×, 100× oil)** – The primary magnifiers; also the main drivers of **resolution** and **working distance**.\n\n   * **4× (scanning):** wide field, easy to find the specimen.\n   * **10× (low):** more detail, still forgiving.\n   * **40× (high dry):** fine detail; use **fine focus only**.\n   * **100× oil:** highest detail; requires immersion oil to boost NA and resolution.\n\n5. **Stage** – Platform that holds the slide. Often a **mechanical stage** with **X–Y controls** for precise movement.\n\n6. **Slide & stage clips** – Secure the specimen directly over the light path.\n\n7. **Coarse focus knob** – Moves the stage quickly to find focus at low power.\n\n8. **Fine focus knob** – Small, precise motion for sharp focus, especially at 40×/100×.\n\n9. **Condenser** – A lens system that concentrates light onto the specimen; usually raised close to the underside of the slide for brightfield.\n\n10. **Iris diaphragm (substage)** – Adjustable aperture beneath the condenser. **Open** for brightness and resolution; **close** for more contrast (but less resolution). Use together with the condenser height.\n\n11. **Field diaphragm (if present)** – Controls the illuminated field size; helps set Köhler illumination and reduce stray light.\n\n12. **Illuminator / LED** – The light source. Often paired with a **brightness control** on the base.\n\n13. **On/Off & brightness control** – Powers the lamp and sets intensity to a comfortable, non-glary level.\n\n14. **Arm** – Structural support; the safe handle when carrying the scope (other hand under the base).\n\n15. **Base & power connector** – House the lamp and electronics; provides stability.\n\n### What’s happening to the image?\n\n* **Illuminator → condenser → specimen:** Light is focused into a cone that passes through the specimen. Transparent/colored areas transmit or absorb light differently, creating contrast.\n* **Specimen → objective:** The objective produces a **real, inverted** magnified image inside the tube.\n* **Objective image → eyepiece:** The eyepiece acts like a magnifier, creating a **virtual image** your eye focuses on.\n* **Result:** High magnification with limited depth of field; tiny focus adjustments and proper illumination are crucial.\n\nIf you want, I can make a printable one-page “How it works + parts” handout using this same diagram.\n",

    "question": "How to Connect One Router to Another to Expand a Network？ Provide steps with images and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Connect the modem to the first router. Use an Ethernet cable to connect to the WAN port of a router to the WAN/Internet port of the high-speed modem. For the purpose of this wikiHow, we will refer to the router that’s connected to the modem as “Router 1.\" Some routers act as a high-speed modem and router. If this is the case for Router 1, simply connect it to the cable that carries your internet connection. The WAN port may be labeled “Internet.” 2. Connect Router 1 to a computer. Use an Ethernet cable to connect from one of Router 1’s LAN ports to a computer’s Ethernet port. You can also connect to the router wirelessly using the wi-fi name and passkey. 3. Turn on the modem and Router 1. Allow a few moments for them both to boot up. 4. Open a web browser. You’ll need a web browser to connect to the admin user interface of Router 1. 5. Enter Router 1's IP address in the address bar. Type the IP address for Router 1 into the address bar at the top of your web browser. This opens the router's admin login screen. Check the user's manual or manufacturer's website to find the default IP address for Router 1. Here are some default IP addresses for common router brands: 2Wire: 192.168.1.1, 192.168.0.1, 192.168.1.254, 10.0.0.138 Apple: 10.0.0.1 Belkin: 192.168.1.1, 192.168.2.1, 10.0.0.2, 10.1.1.1 Dlink: 192.168.1.1, 192.168.0.1, 192.168.0.101, 192.168.0.30, 192.168.0.50, 192.168.15.1, 192.168.254.254, 192.168.1.254, 192.168.0.10, 192.168.15.1, 10.0.0.1, 10.0.0.2, 10.1.1.1, 10.90.90.90, Netgear: 192.168.0.1, 192.168.0.227 6. Log in using Router 1's admin username and password. This opens Router 1's admin user interface. Check the user's manual, or the manufacturer's website to find the default username and password for the Router 1. Most router's use \"admin\" as the username and password. You can also try \"Password\" or \"12345678\" as the password. For some router's, the username or password is left blank. If you’re using the right password but still can’t connect, check the user's manual or manufacturer's website to learn how to reset the router's to it's factory settings. 7. Enable DHCP on Router 1. This will allow Router 1 to assign all of the IP addresses in your network. You can usually find these settings under “Network settings,” or “LAN settings.” The admin user interface layout is different from one router make and model to another. In most cases, the DHCP server is turned on by default. 8. Test your network and internet connection. [6] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source Visit any website (like https://www.wikihow.com ) to verify that you can connect to the Internet. Make sure that the physical configuration of your network leaves room for one LAN port to be open on Router 1. 9. Disconnect Router 1 from the computer. Remove the Ethernet cable between Router 1 and the computer. Everything else can remain on and plugged in. 10. Plug the second router in and turn it on. Make sure you have a free electrical outlet and a computer near where you want the second router to be located. Plug it in and turn it on. For the purposes of this wikiHow, we will refer to the second router as \"Router 2\". 11. Connect a computer to the Router 2. Use an Ethernet cable to connect to the LAN port on Router 2. Then connect to the Ethernet port on a computer. 12. Type Router 2's IP address in the address bar of a web browser. This opens the admin login screen for Router 2. With most router's, the IP address is 192.168.0.1, 192.168.1.1, or 10.0.0.1. 13. Log in using Router 2's username and password. Use the default username and password to log in to the admin user interface for Router 2, just as you did with Router 1. Check the user's manual or manufacturer's website to find the default username and password. With most routers, \"admin\" is both the username and password. 14. Disable DHCP on Router 2. Since DHCP is enabled on Router 1, it should be disabled on Router 2 to prevent IP conflicts. Locate the DHCP settings in the admin user interface and switch the DHCP server to “Off.” 15. Assign a new IP address to Router 2. As of now, there’s a good possibility that Routers 1 and 2 have the same default IP address. To prevent IP conflicts, Router 2 needs to have a different IP address than Router 1. Find the area in the routers admin user interface called “LAN” or “Local Network.” There should be a box that contains the current IP address. Type a new IP address in place of the existing one. The new IP address on Router 2 must be on the same subnet as Router 1. This means the first three sets of numbers in the IP address should be the same as Router 1. Change the number after the third period in the IP address to something different from Router 1. It also can’t be an IP currently assigned to another device. 16. Configure Router 2's Wi-Fi name and passkey. They should be identical to Router 1. You should find these settings under a menu called “Wireless”, “Wi-Fi setup”, or something similar If you’re unsure of Router 1’s SSID and passkey, it should be printed on the device. Router 2 is not a wireless router, skip this step. 17. Disconnect the power from Router 2. Now that Router 2’s all set up, it’s a good idea to give it a restart—though, for now, leave the power unplugged instead of turning it right back on. 18. Connect the first router to the second router. Use an Ethernet cable to connect to a LAN port on Router 1. Then connect to the first LAN port on Router 2. Make sure you’re not plugging it into the WAN port as they look similar. 19. Plug Router 2 back in and turn it on. When the router comes back up, it will have the IP address you configured. As long as Router 1 has Internet access, Router 2 will now also be online. 20. Restart the computer that’s connected to Router 2. Anytime you connect a computer to a new network device, it's a good idea to restart your computer. 21. Connect other computers and devices. This can be done wirelessly , or by connecting Ethernet cables to unused LAN ports on either router. Router 1’s DHCP server will automatically assign each device its own IP address in the same subnet. Enjoy your expanded network!",

If you want any of them tweaked—colors, labels, or brand-specific screenshots—say the word and I’ll regenerate.)\n\n1. **Overview: Two Ways to Connect One Router to Another**\n2. **LAN-to-LAN (Access Point mode) – step-by-step**\n3. **LAN-to-WAN (Router-behind-Router) – step-by-step**\n4. **Placement & Channel Planning**\n\n# Text Steps\n\n## Before you start\n\n* **Pick your method**\n\n  * **LAN-to-LAN (Access Point/AP mode)** — one big network, seamless roaming. *Recommended for most homes.*\n  * **LAN-to-WAN (Double NAT)** — creates a second, isolated network. *Good for guests, kids, or separating work gear.*\n* **What you need**: Router 1 (already on the internet), Router 2, one Ethernet cable (Cat5e or better), a laptop/phone to configure Router 2.\n\n---\n\n## Option A — LAN-to-LAN (Access Point/AP mode)  *(matches Image 2)*\n\nThis turns Router 2 into a simple access point/switch on the **same** network as Router 1.\n\n1. **Connect to Router 2**\n   Plug your laptop into a LAN port on Router 2 (or join its default Wi-Fi). Open its admin page.\n\n2. **Set Router 2 a fixed LAN IP on Router 1’s subnet**\n\n   * Example: if **Router 1** is `192.168.1.1` and its DHCP pool is `192.168.1.100–192.168.1.199`, set **Router 2** to **`192.168.1.2`**.\n   * Aim for an address **outside** Router 1’s DHCP pool to avoid conflicts.\n\n3. **Turn off DHCP on Router 2**\n   Router 1 will be the only device handing out addresses.\n\n4. **Wi-Fi settings on Router 2**\n\n   * For seamless roaming: **same SSID and password** as Router 1.\n   * Set **different channels** to reduce interference:\n\n     * 2.4 GHz: use **1/6/11** (pick a different one than Router 1).\n     * 5 GHz: pick a different channel band (auto is usually fine).\n\n5. **Wire it LAN-to-LAN**\n   Run an Ethernet cable from a **LAN port** on Router 1 to a **LAN port** on Router 2 (do **not** use Router 2’s WAN port).\n\n6. **Place Router 2 well**\n   Put it roughly midway between dead zones and Router 1 (see Image 4). Avoid metal cabinets, microwaves, and thick concrete walls.\n\n7. **Test**\n   Walk around with your phone—signal should stay strong and your device should keep one IP range (e.g., `192.168.1.x`).\n\n---\n\n## Option B — LAN-to-WAN (Router-behind-Router / Double NAT)  *(matches Image 3)*\n\nThis keeps Router 2 as a full router on a **different** subnet. Devices on Router 2 are isolated from Router 1 unless you add special rules.\n\n1. **Connect to Router 2**\n   Log into the admin page.\n\n2. **Use a different LAN subnet on Router 2**\n\n   * Example: leave **Router 1** at `192.168.1.1`.\n   * Set **Router 2** LAN to **`192.168.2.1`** (or any different private subnet). Keep **DHCP ON** on Router 2.\n\n3. **Wire it LAN-to-WAN**\n   Cable from a **LAN port** on Router 1 to the **WAN/Internet** port on Router 2. WAN on Router 2 should be set to **DHCP/Automatic**.\n\n4. **Wi-Fi settings**\n\n   * You can reuse the same SSID/password or choose a **different** name to make it clear which network is which (e.g., “Home-Guest”).\n\n5. **Test**\n   Devices on Router 2 should receive `192.168.2.x` addresses and have internet.\n   *(Note: gaming consoles, servers, or VPNs may need extra port forwarding because of double NAT.)*\n\n---\n\n## Quick Troubleshooting\n\n* **Can’t reach Router 2 after changing its IP?**\n  Temporarily set your laptop to a manual IP on that subnet (e.g., `192.168.1.10`) and browse to Router 2’s new address.\n* **IP conflict or no internet in AP mode?**\n  Make sure **DHCP is OFF** on Router 2 and its IP doesn’t sit inside Router 1’s DHCP pool.\n* **Wi-Fi drops or poor speeds?**\n  Move Router 2 farther from Router 1 and use different channels (1/6/11 on 2.4 GHz).\n* **Double NAT issues (Option B)**\n  If a device needs inbound connections (server, P2P, gaming), add **port forwarding** on **both** routers or switch to **Option A**.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n* For one seamless home network, use **Option A (LAN-to-LAN/AP mode)**.\n* For a segregated guest or work network, use **Option B (LAN-to-WAN/Double NAT)**.\n\nIf you tell me your current router’s IP and DHCP range, I can plug in exact values for you.\n\",",

You will have to scroll a bit to find this option, as it's at the bottom of the section that begins with General . 3. Click on Analytics & Improvements . It's near the bottom of the screen. 4. Ensure Share iPad Analytics is toggled. If this setting isn't toggled on, your iPad will not generate the logs needed to decipher your battery health. If you just toggled this setting on now, you'll need to wait a minimum of 24 hours for your iPad to create the correct analytics log. 5. Click on Analytics Data . A list of logs should pop up. 6. Find the most recent Analytics log. You are looking for a log that is titled Analytics . The numbers after Analytics are a date, so select the one that is the most recent. Logs titled analyticsd.diskwrites will not work for this method. If you're on iOS 15 or earlier, the correct analytics log will be titled log-aggregated . 7. Copy the log into a text editor. You can use the Notes app on your iPad or you can export the log file to a computer. 8. Search for MaximumCapacityPercent . The number after that phrase is your current maximum battery capacity. This number is a percentage, so if your log gives you a 90 after this number, your battery capacity is at 90%. You can search the log by using Find in Note if you're using the Notes app. Find in Note is located under the three-dot menu in the upper right-hand corner. On a computer, you can use the Find function , which is available in most text editors by clicking Ctrl + F on Windows or Cmd + F Mac. 9. Search for CycleCount . The number after that phrase is the current battery cycle count. Every time your iPad battery is charged from 0 to 100, that counts as a cycle.
