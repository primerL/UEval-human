    "reference_text": "1. 1. Begin the dog cartoon outline by drawing his face. Outline the eyes using curved lines. Extend the side of one eye to form the top of the long snout or muzzle. 2. 2. At the end of the snout, draw a circle. This is the dog’s nose. Use curved lines to trace the side of the dog’s face and his forehead. Above the eyes, use curved lines to enclose the pointed eyebrows 3. 3. Draw the dog’s open, smiling mouth. Below the nose, draw a wide, curved “W” shaped line. Let it meet the nose on one side. On the other, extend the arm of the “W” all the way to the corner of the mouth. Below this, use curved lines to outline the lower jaw, the inside of the mouth, and the tongue. Contour the corner of the mouth with short lines. At the front of the snout, draw two small, triangular teeth. 4. 4. Use curved lines to enclose the rounded shapes of the dog’s ears. Then, use long curved lines to trace the top of the head, neck, and side of the body. 5. 5. Extend a long curved line below the lower jaw to form the chest. Then, use a pair of long curved lines to draw the leg. At the bottom, use overlapping curved lines to create the toes and enclose the paw. 6. 6. Contour the chest with a curved line and draw the remaining front leg. Again, use curved lines. Those at the toes should overlap. 7. 7. Draw the rear leg, bent into a sitting position, using curved lines. Again the toes should utilize overlapping curved lines. 8. 8. Draw the remaining leg of the sitting dog. Use curved lines for the back, the bent leg, and the round paw. Band the paw with short lines. 9. 9. Complete your dog cartoon outline by drawing his wagging tail. Extend two curved lines from the dog’s hip and allow them to meet at a sharp point. Beside the tail, sketch a hatch mark pattern using curved lines to simulate the motion of the tail. 10. Color your cartoon dog. We’ve shaded ours dark brown like a chocolate labrador dog.",

    "generated_text": "Here’s a simple, beginner-friendly way to draw a cute cartoon dog (front view, sitting). Keep your lines light until the end—then trace the final outline darker.\n\nYou’ll need: pencil, eraser, black pen/marker, and optional colored pencils/markers.\n\nStep-by-step (8 steps)\n\nHead & muzzle\nDraw a big circle for the head. Lightly add a short vertical guideline. At the bottom of the circle, sketch a small horizontal oval for the muzzle (it overlaps the circle).\n\nEars\nAdd two floppy, teardrop-like ears on the sides of the head. Their tips should hang lower than the midpoint of the head.\n\nNose & smile\nOn the muzzle, draw a small rounded triangle for the nose. From its sides, curve two short lines downward to suggest a smile. Add a wide “U” under the smile for the mouth/tongue.\n\nEyes & brows\nAbove the muzzle, draw two big ovals for eyes. Add tiny white circles for highlights and fill the pupils around them. Two small curved dashes above each eye make friendly brows.\n\nBody shape\nUnder the head, draw a wide “U” shape for the chest/body. Let the head overlap the body slightly (no neck needed).\n\nFront legs & paws\nFrom the body, add two long “U” shapes straight down for the front legs. At the bottom, draw 3 small bumps on each paw to suggest toes.\n\nBack leg & tail\nOn one side, add a “C” shaped curve for the back leg with a small oval paw peeking out. Sketch a short curved tail to one side.\n\nDetails, cleanup & style\nAdd a collar band and tiny tag under the head if you like. Erase extra construction lines. Trace your final outline with thicker, smooth lines. Optional spots/patches and a soft ground shadow under the paws.\n\nQuick coloring guide (optional)\n\nCoat: light brown or cream\n\nEars/patches: slightly darker brown\n\nNose: black; Tongue: pink\n\nCollar: any bright color (e.g., blue)\n\nLeave small white shines in the eyes\n\nProportion tip: Big head + small body + big eyes = instant cute.\nVariation: Try perky ears, a curlier tail, or different spot patterns.",

    "reference_text": "1. 1. Begin the owl babies outline by drawing the bird’s huge, round eyes. First, outline two circles. Use two curved lines that don’t quite meet to draw each. Then, shade a large round pupil inside each eye. Between them, draw an inverted teardrop shape. This is the owlet’s beak. Draw two short lines inside it to form the nostrils. Next, draw the fluffy feathers on top of the animal’s head. Use a series of short, curved lines that meet at jagged points. 2. 2. Draw a series of short, curved, connected lines above each eye. Use a similar series of lines - short ones that meet at gentle points - to outline the round, feathered face. Then, draw a series of lines that meet at points to outline the side of its round body. 3. 3. Use a series of curved lines that meet at jagged points to draw the opposite side of the baby’s body. Draw the owl’s legs, using long lines for the outsides, and connect them with a series of short lines. 4. 4. Texture the feathers of the owl’s chest using a series of short curved lines. Then, draw the bird’s foot. Draw three teardrop-shaped claws. Draw “U” shaped lines passing behind them to form the toes. 5. 5. Draw the owl’s remaining foot. Again, draw three teardrop-shaped claws with “U” shaped lines passing behind them to form the toes. Then, begin the second owlet. Draw the eyes, using two curved lines that don’t quite meet to draw each. Shade a large round pupil inside each eye. Draw a curved triangle between the eyes, forming the beak. 6. 6. Outline the feathery head using a series of short curved lines that meet at jagged points. Draw similar lines above the eyes. Draw a small nostril within the beak. 7. 7. Use a series of short, curved, jagged lines to draw the wing, and another for the belly. 8. 8. Draw the second owl’s feet. First, draw teardrop shapes for the six talons. Then, use curved lines to sketch the toes. 9. 9. Texture each owlet’s feathers with individual curved lines and connected lines in series. Notice the bellies, the base of the neck, and the area around the beak. 10. Your owl babies outline is now complete. Color your picture. Different species of owl have different feather colors, but they range from brown to gray.",

Keep them symmetrical.\n\n4. **Pupils & highlights**\n   Inside each eye, draw a smaller circle for the iris/pupil. Add a tiny white highlight circle so the eyes look lively.\n\n5. **Beak**\n   Between the eyes on the center line, draw a small diamond/triangle pointing down.\n\n6. **Wings**\n   On each side of the body, draw a long curved “(” and “)” shape for wings that stop above the feet area.\n\n7. **Belly patch & feather marks**\n   Draw a rounded oval on the belly. Add 2–3 rows of small “~” or “U” shapes for feathers.\n\n8. **Feet (and a branch, optional)**\n   Two stubby feet made of three rounded toes each (like a soft “W”). If you want, place them on a simple branch.\n\n9. **Clean line art**\n   Trace your favorite lines with a darker pen/marker. Erase all construction lines and overlaps.\n\n10. **Color**\n    Body: light–medium brown. Wings: darker brown. Belly: cream. Beak/feet: yellow-orange. Add a leaf on the branch for a pop of green.\n\n**Quick tips**\n\n* Keep lines light until the clean-up step.\n* If the owl looks grumpy, lift the inner top curves of the eyes a touch.\n* Big eyes and a small beak = cuter style.\n",

They should meet in a gentle curve on the top end, but they should not connect on the bottom end. This outlines the body, or fuselage, of the rocket. 3. 3. Enclose the open end of the rocket using a pair of straight lines. 4. 4. Band the nose cone with two pairs of curved parallel lines. 5. 5. Draw portholes, or small windows, along the side of the rocket. To do so, draw several circles of different sizes. 6. 6. Draw the rocket's fin. First, draw a straight line from the tail of the rocket to its middle. Then, draw curved lines downward from each end of the straight line. Allow the curved lines to meet at a gentle point. 7. 7. Erase guide lines from the fin. 8. 8. Draw the rocket's second fin. To do so, extend two curved lines from the top side of the rocket - one emerging from the middle of the ship, the other from its base. Allow the lines to meet at a gentle point. 9. 9. Draw the flames, called exhaust, coming from the rocket's nozzle, or base. Use a series of short curved lines that meet in jagged points to draw a rounded triangular shape. Then, use another series of lines to draw a second layer. Finally, draw the third layer of the exhaust, allowing it to end at a point. 10. Color your rocket. Rockets such as the one in this drawing guide were popular illustrations during the 1950s and 1960s. Some were silver in color, while others had bright red, blue, or other colored markings.",

    "reference_text": "1. 1. Begin the cartoon snail outline by drawing the snail's head. First, draw two circles. These will become the snail's eyes. Draw a curved line across each circle. In the lower half of the circle, draw a pie chart or Pacman shape - a circle with a missing triangular slice. What does a Pacman shape look like, exactly? Check out this Pacman pixel art . Below each eye, extend two curved lines. These are the snail's eyestalks. Then, connect the stalks with an overlapping curved line, contouring the snail's face. 2. 2. Continue the line of the face. This line should be long and wavy, outlining the bottom of the sticky, slimy foot. 3. 3. Draw another wavy line roughly parallel to the foot, allowing the lines to meet at a point. Draw two curved lines across the face, forming the smiling mouth and the chin. Place a short curved line at the corner of the mouth. 4. 4. Extend the remaining side of the head with a long curved line. Double the line back on itself at the end to begin constructing the base of the shell. Connect the tip of the foot to the shell with a curved line. 5. 5. Begin the spiral shape of the snail shell by drawing a large \"C\" shaped line. Connect it to the snail's head with a short line. 6. 6. Continue the line of the shell to enclose the circle. Continue the line past the point of completion to begin the spiral pattern. 7. 7. Continue the spiral-shaped line. 8. 8. Enclose partial circles all along the spiral line. Notice that the circles grow smaller near the inside of the spiral. 9. 9. Fill the snail shell with more circular spots. Color your cartoon snail. We've given ours a green and yellow body with a tan and brown spotted snail. 10. Throughout much of the world, garden snails are usually brown in color. But some snails - especially the ocean and marsh-dwelling snails - have vivid black-and-white patterns or unusually bright colors .",

Shell rim\n   Add a curved outline along the outside-left of the circle to give the shell a visible edge.\n\n4. Body & head\n   Under the shell, sketch a soft “bean” shape for the body, with a bump for the head in front.\n\n5. Eyestalks\n   From the head, draw two thin curved stalks. Put small circles on top for eyes.\n\n6. Face & base\n   Add a tiny smile and a closed-eye curve (or dots for pupils). Draw a gently flattened oval under the body for the foot/base.\n\n7. Details\n   Add a couple of small dots on the cheek and a few light dashes or spots on the shell for texture. You can also draw a short ground line.\n\n8. Clean & color\n   Trace final lines darker; erase extra guidelines. Color the body a warm beige or peach, the shell a green or yellow with a slightly darker spiral. Add a small shadow under the snail. Optional: a tiny mushroom or blade of grass for charm.\n\n",

    "question": "How to bake cookies from scratch? Provide a visual guide and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Keep everything cold. If you are using butter in your cookies (and even, to a certain degree, if you aren't) you will want to keep your ingredients refrigerator-cold. This will make your cookies much more firm and keep them from spreading out in the oven. This means that you'll have to warm up the butter enough to work with it by placing it on the counter, rather than in the microwave. Absolutely never melt it in order to mix it into the dough. A great practice is to cool your dough in the fridge for an hour before rolling it out. 2. Always cream butter and sugar. If your recipe calls for butter and doesn't specifically prohibit this practice, you should always \"cream\" the butter and the sugar first. This is a process by which you mix the two until a sort of paste is formed. 3. Try to use salted butter. Sweet cream butter tends to make cookies taste too sweet. The salt will balance out the sweetness of the cookie just enough to make it taste much better over all. You won't be able to properly taste the salt, but believe us, you'll notice the difference. 4. Change the recipe to alter the final product. If you find a recipe that you love the taste of but want a different texture, it is totally possible to alter the recipe just a bit in order to get exactly what you want! Experiment, or try these tricks: Use cake flour instead of regular flour, shortening instead of butter (or for part of the butter), or about 2 teaspoons of cornstarch along with 4 teaspoons less flour in order to get fluffy, cakey, and softer cookies. Use 2 tablespoons of milk, an extra tablespoon or two of butter, or switch your white sugar for brown to get a crispy cookie. Use melted butter to mix dough and then chill it before baking (undercook a minute or two) to get a chewy cookie. You can also use only yolks, instead of whites. Using a rubber spatula often helps speed up the mixing process if you are not using a machine. 5. Weigh your ingredients. If you find that you still struggle with getting your recipe to turn out right, bake like the pros (and Europeans!) do and weigh your ingredients. Get a good electronic kitchen scale and do your recipe based on weight. This will help ensure the perfect cookie. 6. Use an ice cream scoop to make cookies even. If you want to make sure that every cookie in a batch turns out looking the same, use an ice cream scoop to get perfectly equal balls of dough. 7. Use parchment paper. Skip the Silpat in favor of parchment paper. Silpat can make it difficult for cookies to cook evenly and it also keeps the bottoms from developing that perfect crispness. Parchment paper turns out a much better cookie. 8. Bake on the bottom of your cookie sheet. If you notice that the cookies at the edge of your sheet are prone to getting over cooked, use an Round or oval pan. If you don't have one, improvise and flip the pan over to use the bottom! 9. Know your oven. Every oven is different and it is important for you to know how yours behaves. If you know what to expect, then you can find ways to work around the expected problems. For example, if you notice that cookies on one corner or side bake faster than in another, make sure you turn the pan part-way through the baking process. 10. Start with a cold pan. Put your baking sheet in the fridge to cool before you put each set of cookies on. If you want to save time, you can scoop the dough onto parchment paper and store them in the fridge until they are ready to go out on a cooled pan. This means cooling the pan between each set of 12 too! 11. Don't overbake your cookies. If anything it's better to under-bake them. For the first batch carefully watch them and time for when they get the first hint of brown at the edges. Edge browning usually means you've gone too far, though these cookies are still perfectly good (especially if you like yours crispy!). Once you know how long it takes to reach that point, pull them out maybe 30 seconds before they brown for perfectly soft cookies. If you are using white chocolate chips in your cookies, be careful, as they can burn particularly easily. 12. Let cookies sit on the pan. Let your cookies sit on the pan for a few minutes before taking them off. This will let them firm up on the bottom, making them much easier to remove.",

I’ll generate the visual as a separate image right after this.\n\n# Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies (from scratch)\n\n**Yield:** ~18 cookies (40–45g each)\n**Time:** 20 min prep + 10–12 min bake (per tray)\n\n## Ingredients\n\n* 225 g (1¾ cups) all-purpose flour\n* ½ tsp baking soda\n* ½ tsp fine salt\n* 170 g (¾ cup) unsalted butter, softened (cool room temp)\n* 150 g (¾ cup, packed) light brown sugar\n* 100 g (½ cup) granulated sugar\n* 1 large egg **+** 1 extra yolk (for extra chew)\n* 2 tsp vanilla extract\n* 200–225 g (1¼–1½ cups) chocolate chips or chopped chocolate\n\n## Equipment\n\n2 mixing bowls, whisk, hand/stand mixer (or sturdy spoon), rubber spatula, cookie scoop or spoons, baking sheet, parchment.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. **Prep oven & pans**\n   Preheat to **350°F / 175°C**. Line a baking sheet with parchment.\n\n2. **Dry mix**\n   Whisk **flour, baking soda, and salt** in a bowl; set aside.\n\n3. **Cream**\n   In a separate bowl, beat **butter + both sugars** on medium until **pale and fluffy (1–2 min)**.\n\n4. **Eggs & vanilla**\n   Beat in **egg, then yolk, then vanilla** just until smooth.\n\n5. **Combine**\n   Add dry ingredients. Mix on low or fold until **just combined** (no dry streaks; avoid overmixing).\n\n6. **Chocolate**\n   Fold in chocolate.\n\n7. **Scoop & (optional) chill**\n   Scoop **2 Tbsp (40–45g)** mounds, well-spaced. For thicker cookies, **chill 15–30 min**.\n\n8. **Bake**\n   Bake **10–12 min** until **edges are set and lightly golden** and **centers still look soft/puffy**.\n\n9. **Set & cool**\n   Cool on the sheet **5 min**, then transfer to a rack. They’ll finish setting as they cool.\n\n## Doneness Cues\n\n* Edges: lightly golden;\n* Centers: soft, a touch pale;\n* Surface: faint cracks with glossy melted chocolate.\n\n## Pro Tips\n\n* **Temperature matters:** butter should be soft but cool (no oily sheen).\n* **Thickness control:** Chill longer for thicker cookies; bake right away for thinner, chewier edges.\n* **Wrinkly tops:** Halfway through baking, **rap** the pan once on the rack.\n\n## Variations\n\n* **Browned-Butter:** Brown 170 g butter; cool till just fluid, then proceed. Adds a nutty note (cookies spread a bit more).\n* **Nutty Crunch:** Add ½ cup toasted chopped pecans or walnuts.\n* **Salted:** Finish with a **pinch of flaky salt** after baking.\n* **Oat-Choc Chip:** Swap 50 g (½ cup) of flour for quick oats.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n* **Too flat:** Butter too warm; dough under-chilled; oven too cool.\n* **Too cakey/dry:** Over-measured flour; overbaked; overmixed.\n* **Greasy edges:** Butter too warm; try chilling 30–60 min.\n\n## Storage & Make-Ahead\n\n* **Baked:** Airtight at room temp **3–4 days**.\n* **Dough balls:** Freeze on a tray, then bag; bake from frozen **12–14 min** at 350°F.\n\n——\n\nI’ll now generate a separate step-by-step visual guide that matches this recipe. 😊\n\n\nIf you’d like the visual saved as a printable PDF or with different colors/sizes, tell me your preference and I’ll regenerate it to match.",

    "reference_text": "1. Wash your hands before cleaning your glasses. Wash up for 20 seconds with lotion-free soap and warm water. You’ll need to make sure your hands are free of dirt, grease, and grime before cleaning your glasses. 2. Rinse your glasses with warm water. Run a gentle stream of tap water over your glasses. Rotate them to wet both sides of each lens, the frame, and earpieces. Hot water is bad for lenses, protective coatings, and the frame, so be sure to use warm water. 3. Use your fingertips to carefully lather them with dish soap. Add a small drop of lotion-free dish soap to each lens. Make gentle circular motions with your fingertips to lather the soap over both sides of your lenses, around the frame, and down each earpiece. 4. Clean the nose pads with a cotton swab or soft toothbrush. Use gentle pressure as you scrub the nose pads and the crevices between them and the frame. If you’re using a toothbrush, make sure it’s soft-bristled. Avoid grazing the lenses with the toothbrush, even if it’s soft-bristled. If there’s buildup between the lenses and the frame, use a cotton swab to loosen it. 5. Wash away soap residue. Hold the glasses under running water again to rinse away soap suds. Make sure you’ve washed away all traces of soap, as any remaining residue will cause smudges. 6. Shake off excess water and make sure your lenses are clean. Turn off the water, then give your glasses a careful shake. Check the lenses to make sure they’re clear, and wash them again if you see any smudges. 7. Dry your glasses with a microfiber cloth. Fold a clean microfiber cloth over both sides of a lens. Make soft circular motions with your fingertips to dry it, then repeat on the other lens. Wipe the nose pads, then use the cloth to dry and polish the frame and earpieces. [6] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source 8. Spray your glasses liberally with eyeglass cleaner. Spray cleaners for eyewear are available at pharmacies and eyewear retailers. If you can’t get to a sink and dish soap, spray your glasses with lots of cleaner to flush away dirt and debris. Some eyewear manufacturers and optometrists also offer free samples of spray cleaner. If you have anti-reflective (AR) glasses, make sure the cleaner you use is labelled safe for the AR coating. 9. Wipe away the cleaner with a microfiber cloth. After spraying your glasses, carefully wipe off excess cleaner. Fold the cloth over both sides of each lens, and make gentle circular motions with your fingertips to absorb the cleaner. Then use the cloth to dry the frame and earpieces. 10. Touch up your lenses with disposable eyeglass wet wipes. You can also clean your glasses with wet wipes when you’re on the go. Gently blow on them to remove dust and dirt, then gently rub them with a wet wipe using soft, circular motions. After cleaning them, dry them with a microfiber cloth. Only use wet wipes labelled for cleaning eyewear. If you have AR glasses, make sure your wipes are labelled safe for the AR coating. 11. Clean your glasses every morning and as needed. Make cleaning your glasses part of your morning routine. Check them regularly throughout the day, and touch them up as needed. Keeping your glasses clean and smudge-free will help prevent scratches. 12. Store your glasses in a hard case when you’re not wearing them. Don’t just throw your glasses in your purse or bag, and avoid placing the lenses on hard surfaces. When they’re not in use, keep them in a hard-shell case. The case should fit your glasses; if it’s too big, they might roll around and get damaged. [11] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source 13. Wash your microfiber cloths frequently. Microfiber cloths collect grease and dirt, so you should wash yours after 2 or 3 uses. Some cloths are machine washable, so check the care instructions and launder them as directed. [12] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source If your cloth isn’t machine washable, or if you’re not sure, hand wash it with dish soap, wring it out, then let it air dry. 14. Don’t wipe your glasses with your shirt, tissue, or a paper towel. Shirts, tissues, and paper towels contain fine debris that could scratch your glasses. Additionally, never wipe your glasses when they’re dry, or you’ll risk damaging them. Exhaling on your glasses and wiping them with your shirt might be convenient, but that’s a quick way to scratch up your lenses. Need help keeping your glasses clean?

    "question": "How to clean a cutting board? Provide steps with visuals and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Rinse your board right after using it. Rinse your board with water right after you use it, rather than waiting until the end of the meal or even the next day when you clean it. This will help minimize bacteria growth and keep your board cleaner. Resist the urge to throw your board in the sink after the meal and forget about it. 2. Clean your board with dish soap and hot water. To clean your cutting board, scrub it with a few drops of dish soap on a sponge and some hot water. [2] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview Be sure to remove any food particles as you wash, paying particular attention to any grooves or scrapes in your board. Food can collect in these spots. Never clean a wooden cutting board in the dishwasher or soak it in water. The wood will absorb water, which can lead to bacteria and mold forming. [4] X Expert Source James Sears House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview 3. Rinse your board. Rinse your board to remove any traces of soap. You don’t want whatever you cook next to taste like your dish soap. [5] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview 4. Dry your board thoroughly to prevent cracking. After you’re finished washing your cutting board, dry it thoroughly with a clean dishtowel, removing any excess water. This is particularly important if your board is made of wood, as they are more prone to cracks. 5. Use a combination of white vinegar and baking soda. To sanitize your cutting board after use, sprinkle it with some baking soda. Then, spray the baking soda–covered board with white vinegar. This will fizz, helping draw stains out of your board and deodorizing it. Let this mix sit for 5 minutes and then rinse your board with water, drying as normal. 6. Disinfect your board with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Just as hydrogen peroxide can clean a wound, it can also clean your cutting board. Sprinkle your board with 3% hydrogen peroxide solution, and let it stand for 1 minute to kill any surface bacteria. Then, rinse your board with water, and dry with a dishtowel as normal. [8] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview Hydrogen peroxide can bleach porous surfaces like wood. Don’t let the solution sit too long or it might fade your cutting board. 7. Remove stains with a scrub of coarse salt. For deep, set-in stains on your cutting board, use a coarse salt, such as kosher salt, as a scrub. [10] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview Wet a sponge and use a handful of salt to scour your board, focusing on any areas of discoloration. Rinse your board with water when finished, and dry with a clean towel. [11] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview Be sure to wash your hands well and moisturize them with lotion after scrubbing your board with salt. It can be very drying. Another option is wearing kitchen gloves. 8. Wash your board with diluted bleach once a month. Especially if you work with raw meats and fish on your cutting board, use a diluted bleach solution to do a deep clean of your board once a month. Make a solution that’s 1/8th bleach and 7/8ths water. Wet a sponge, and scrub your board with the solution. Rinse well with plain water and dry your board as normal with a clean towel. 9. Rub your board with a lemon to deodorize once a week. To keep your board smelling fresh, use half of a cut lemon to deodorize your board. Rub the cut-side of the lemon along the length of the board side to side. Then, rinse with plain water, and dry with a clean towel. 10. Condition your cutting board weekly. If your cutting board is made of wood, use mineral oil to condition your board after it’s clean. This will keep it in optimal condition. Do not use organic oils or fats, which can turn rancid, to lubricate your board. Look for products labeled kitchen-grade white mineral oil, such as Howard’s Cutting Board Oil. There are other mineral oils meant for lubricating machinery but not for consumption. Look specifically for kitchen-grade oil. You can condition your board every time you clean it, or a minimum of once a week. Simply rub your board with the conditioner, and let it air try so the oil can soak in.",

Place a damp towel under the board so it won’t slip.\n\n2. **Remove crown & base**\n\n* Lay the pineapple on its side. Slice off about ½ inch from the top (crown) and bottom to make flat ends.\n\n3. **Stand and peel**\n\n* Stand it upright. Following the curve of the fruit, slice downward in long strips to remove the skin. Keep cuts shallow to save fruit.\n\n4. **Remove the “eyes”**\n\n* You’ll see brown “eyes” left in diagonal rows. Make shallow V-shaped notches along those diagonals (or shave them off) until the flesh is clean.\n\n5. **Choose your cut**\n\n* **Method A — Rings:** Lay the pineapple on its side and slice crosswise into ½-inch discs. Use a small round cutter or a paring knife to remove the hard core circle from each disc.\n* **Method B — Spears & Chunks:** Stand it up. Cut in half lengthwise, then into quarters. Lay each quarter flat and slice off the tough core (a pale, fibrous triangle) from the center edge. Cut quarters into long spears, then into bite-size chunks.\n\n6. **Serve or store**\n\n* Eat right away, or refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 3–4 days. For longer storage, freeze chunks on a tray, then bag.\n\n**Tips**\n\n* A ripe pineapple smells sweet at the base and yields slightly when pressed.\n* For cleaner cuts, wipe juice from the board as you go.\n* Try a sprinkle of lime and chili powder, or grill spears 1–2 minutes per side for caramelization.\n\n(Visual guide generated separately above.)\n",

    "question": "How to clean a coffee maker? Provide illustrated steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Disassemble the coffee maker. Remove any parts that come off, such as the pot, the brew basket, and any other removable parts. These part should be cleaned separately from the rest of the coffee maker. 2. Wash the removable parts. Submerge the removable parts in warm, soapy water, and wash them using a dish rag. You can wash removable parts of your coffee maker the same way you would wash dishes. Glass pots can be very breakable. When washing your coffee maker's pot, treat the glass gingerly. Some coffee makers may have parts that can be washed in a dishwasher. Check the instructions manual, if you still have it. If you're unsure if your coffee maker can be washed in the dishwasher, err on the side of caution and hand wash it. 3. Wipe down the outside of the machine. Take a wet, soapy rag and give the outside of the machine a good wipe down. Wipe down the sides and remove any coffee grinds from the warming plate. When you're down, wipe off any soap suds with a clean, damp rag. 4. Reassemble your machine. After all the parts are dry, you can put your coffee machine back together. It is ready to use again. Make a habit of cleaning your coffee maker like this after each use. 5. Add a vinegar and water solution to your coffee maker. [4] X Expert Source Jonathan Tavarez Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview Make a mixture using 2 parts warm water and 1 part white vinegar. [5] X Expert Source Marcus Shields House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview The precise amounts will vary depending on the size of your coffee maker, but make roughly enough to fill the reservoir. Pour the mixture into the reservoir like you normally would with water when making coffee. 6. Let the coffee machine run half a brew cycle. [7] X Expert Source Jonathan Tavarez Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview Turn the coffee machine on. Keep an eye on it as it brews. Once about half the pot is full with the filtered vinegar/water mixture, turn the pot off. 7. Let the coffee maker sit for an hour. Set a timer for an hour. Let the coffee pot sit for this time frame. This will give the vinegar time to sit in the machine and clean out any mold. 8. Complete the brew cycle. After letting the coffee maker sit for an hour, turn the machine back on. Let it run the rest of the brew cycle. [10] X Expert Source Jonathan Tavarez Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview When done, all the vinegar/water mixture should be filtered into the pot. You can pour this mixture down the sink. 9. Run three brew cycles with plain water. Fill your coffee pot with clean water. Pour this into the reservoir and run a complete brew cycle. [12] X Expert Source Jonathan Tavarez Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview When it's done, pour the water out and run two more brew cycles with clean water. This should clean any vinegar out of your coffee maker. 10. Wipe down the coffee maker. After disinfecting the coffee maker, take a clean, damp rag. Wipe down the exterior of the machine to remove any dirt and debris. You should also make sure to remove coffee grinds from the warming plate. 11. Read your instruction's manual. If you still have the instructions manual, read it before cleaning your coffee maker. Most coffee makers can safely be cleaned with a vinegar/water mixture, but it's always a good idea to check first. [15] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source If you don't have the instructions manual, try looking up your model online. You may be able to find an instructions manual on the Internet. 12. Leave the reservoir lid open. Many people keep the reservoir lid closed. However, it's a good idea to leave it open when not in use. This will help dry out the machine, preventing mold and bacteria from growing in a moist environment. 13. Rinse the brew basket in the sink regularly. The brew basket is very susceptible to mold as it gets wet during the brewing process. Make sure you rinse out the brew basket after each use and make a habit of cleaning it each time you do dishes. This will keep your coffee maker mold and germ free.

Maiko Marine Promenade (self-guided)\n\n* What it is: An enclosed observatory walkway built within the lower truss of the bridge. Long corridors with windows and a few glass-floor sections let you look straight down at the Akashi Strait—without being out in the wind.\n* How to do it: Enter from Maiko Park at the base of the bridge on the Kobe side, buy a ticket, and take the elevator up to the promenade level. It’s a simple come-and-go visit that most ages can do.\n* Good to know: It’s indoors and weather-sheltered. Expect museum-style exhibits, viewing lounges, and occasional glass-floor panels. Check local notices for opening days/hours and maintenance closures.\n\n2. “Bridge World” guided tour (for the adventurous)\n\n* What it is: A reservation-only tour run by the bridge authority. You gear up, walk along service catwalks inside the superstructure, and—on some itineraries—ride an internal elevator and stairs to the top of a main tower for a panorama over Kobe and Awaji.\n* How to do it: Book ahead, arrive on time for the safety briefing, and wear comfortable, closed-toe shoes. Capacity is limited and tours are weather-dependent.\n* Good to know: Age/health restrictions may apply; bags are often limited. Tours can be canceled for strong winds or rain.\n\nGetting there (quick orientation)\n\n* Aim for **Maiko Park** on the Kobe side of the strait. The nearest rail stops are around the Maiko area; from there it’s a short walk to the promenade entrance and the bridge exhibition facilities.\n\nTip\n\n* If you prefer an easy, family-friendly indoor stroll with big views, pick the **Maiko Marine Promenade**. If you want a behind-the-scenes engineering experience (and heights don’t bother you), try to snag a **Bridge World** tour.\n",

    "question": "Why can people shop and walk on the Rialto Bridge in Venice? Provide a photo and explain the structural design.",
    "reference_text": "The Rialto Bridge is the oldest stone bridge across the Grand Canal in Venice. Its central arch supports a covered walkway lined with shops. The strong stone arch distributes weight evenly, allowing both commercial activity and pedestrian traffic on top while boats pass underneath.",
    "reference_images": [
      "data/space/rialto_bridge_shops.jpg"
    ],
    "generated_text": "# Explanation (separate from the image)\n\nPeople can shop and walk on the Rialto Bridge because it was conceived not just as a crossing, but as a **marketplace built into a bridge**:\n\n* **Single-span stone arch:** The bridge is a massive masonry arch that works entirely in **compression**. Its curved profile channels the weight of crowds and the shop structures down into the arch and out toward the banks, where the thrust is resisted by very large abutments. Stone excels at compression, so it can safely carry heavy, steady loads like shops plus pedestrian traffic.\n\n* **No piers in the canal:** Because it’s a single span, there’s **no intermediate pier** in the Grand Canal. That keeps the waterway open for boats while concentrating the structure’s strength in the arch and abutments—freeing the deck to host shops and walkways.\n\n* **Three walkways with shops between:** The bridge carries **two rows of small shops** along its length. Those shop walls act like **spandrel walls**, transferring loads down to the arch. Between and beside the shops are **three pedestrian passages**—a central stairway and two outer side walks—so people can browse and pass through at the same time.\n\n* **Deep foundations and stout abutments:** As with many Venetian structures, the abutments are set on **dense fields of timber piles** driven into the lagoon’s sediments, which become very durable in waterlogged, low-oxygen conditions. This spreads the arch thrust over a large area and keeps settlement small.\n\n* **Durable materials and detailing:** The outer shell uses hard, water-resistant **Istrian stone** with brick and stone within, plus a crowned profile and steps that manage the slope. The permanent “dead load” of the shops actually helps **pre-compress** the arch, improving stability against crowds and wind.\n\n* **Designed for commerce from the start:** Built in the **late 16th century** (1588–1591) under **Antonio da Ponte**, it replaced earlier wooden trading bridges. Integrating stalls into the superstructure formalized the Rialto area’s role as Venice’s commercial heart—so the bridge has always been both a thoroughfare **and** a shopping street.\n\nIn short: the Rialto’s **masonry arch + robust foundations + integrated spandrel/shop walls** create a stiff, compression-only structure that easily carries the weight of shops and dense pedestrian traffic, while leaving the canal completely clear below.\n",

Keep gaze forward.\n\n3. **Press Up**\n\n* Drive the dumbbells **up and slightly back**, letting your head move a touch back so the bells travel close to your face.\n* Keep ribs from flaring; maintain tight glutes and abs.\n* Elbows stay under (or just in front of) the wrists—don’t let them flare wide.\n\n4. **Lockout**\n\n* Finish with arms straight, **biceps near ears**, shoulders down (no shrug).\n* Exhale at the top or through the sticking point. Pause briefly under control.\n\n5. **Lower**\n\n* Pull the weights back to shoulders on a controlled 2–3-second descent.\n* Keep torso tall; don’t lean back or arch.\n\n6. **Breathe & Repeat**\n\n* Reset your brace each rep. Perform 6–12 reps for hypertrophy or 3–6 for strength.\n* Stop 1–2 reps shy of form breakdown.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Tips\n\n* Start lighter than you think; build up in 2–5 lb jumps.\n* If your low back arches, **tighten abs and glutes** or switch to a half-kneeling stance.\n* Think “press the body **under** the bells” rather than pushing them far forward.\n\n### Common Mistakes → Fixes\n\n* **Flaring ribs / big back arch** → Squeeze glutes, exhale, knit ribs down.\n* **Bent-back wrists** → Stack knuckles over forearms; grip the handles firmly.\n* **Press path in front** → Aim slightly back at the top so bells finish over mid-foot.\n* **Shrugging** → Keep shoulder blades set down; don’t chase height with traps.\n\n### Variations\n\n* **Seated press** for more stability.\n* **Arnold press** for extra front-delt/rotation work.\n* **Single-arm press** to train anti-lean core control.\n\nStay smooth and pain-free—if you feel shoulder pinching, reduce range, rotate palms in, or stop.",

Lift\n\n* Press feet and upper arms down, then lift hips until thighs are roughly parallel to the floor and shins vertical.\n* Keep knees tracking over ankles (don’t let them splay). Keep neck neutral—don’t turn your head.\n\n4. Deepen (optional)\n\n* Roll shoulders slightly underneath you and interlace fingers, or keep palms pressing into the mat.\n* Broaden collarbones and lift the sternum toward the chin without jamming the throat.\n* Keep tailbone long and ribs gently down to maintain length in the lower back.\n\n5. Hold\n\n* Breathe slowly for 5–10 breaths. Keep glutes active but not clenched; most of the lift comes from legs and back body.\n\n6.

    "question": "How to do a bench press? Show visual steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Begin by lying flat on the bench, with your body in a natural and relaxed position. Make sure that you are not holding your shoulders in an awkward position. Be sure to have a natural spinal curve. You do not want to have your lower back flat on the bench, but you do not want to force it to curve too much either. Instead, opt for a comfortable and natural position. You should have your feet flat on the ground, shoulder-width apart, and your shoulders touching the bench. Do not lift on a \"cushiony bench\" if you are a heavy lifter. When the bar and plates weigh more than 200 pounds plus the weight of your upper body, your shoulders will disappear into the bench and cause neck strain. Choose a proper bench that fits your shoulder width. A narrow bench is unstable and a wide bench prevents the upper arm from bending back. 2. Put your arms straight out to either side of you, and then bend your elbows, bringing your hands up to touch the bar. This is where you should position your hands. They should be about shoulder-width apart. Use the smooth rings in the bar as a reference for even hand placement. Where you position your hands will affect which muscle group you work most. Widen your grip slightly to increase the amount of pectoral muscles involved in this exercise, and bring your grip in slightly to increase your triceps involvement. For a standard bench press, opt for the normal grip. 3. Begin with just the bar weight to warm up before heavy lifting. Lift the bar off the rack and position it directly above the middle of your chest. Inhale as you lower it down, gently touching your chest — the middle of the sternum — with the bar. Do not bounce the bar off your chest, as this can cause serious injury and promotes bad form . Begin to exhale as you push the bar up and away from your body. Extend your arms to just under full extension. Repeat this for eight repetitions as your first set. Lift with a bar that has a little flex but is not \"whippy\". A stiff bar can be uncomfortable to lift with. All bars are made of metal and relatively stiff, but a bar with some flex feels better on the joints. The salesperson at the store will give you the right bar for your bodyweight, based on the formula for bodyweight and bench press. Generally, a beginning or intermediate lifter is not going to lift over his bodyweight plus 50%. Examine your goals when choosing a bar. For setting a personal record or a state record and above, use a bar with a standard diameter of 1 1 ⁄ 16 inches (2.7 cm). If not concerned with records, a thicker bar does not dig into the palms and is more comfortable. A thicker bar increases the distance of the lift and decreases the amount that can be lifted. A 1/8 (or 1/16) inch increase in bar diameter has a noticeable difference in feel and stability. 4. Rack the bar and add weight. Always use weight clips to prevent the weights from sliding off the bar in the event that you lift unevenly, do not lift without them. The bar by itself weighs 45 pounds. You will want to increase by five to ten pounds at a time until you find a comfortable weight. Practice extra caution if tall. Tall lifters with wide grips should use care not to crush their hands when racking the bar. Weight benches were made for someone tall (6 feet tall and not for a lifter 6 feet 8 inches tall). Tall lifters should not use an extra wide grip. An extra wide grip strains the wrist with excessive radial flexion. Close and wide grips can make the wrist more prone to injury. Avoid using the thumbless grip. If the bar slips off your hands, it would be disastrous. When being spotted by spotters and by a spotting device the thumbless grip is not as dangerous, but the spotting device has to be very, very solid. The thumbless grips is easier on the wrist and conducts power to the bar more directly (you can lift more). Use chalk with both grips. There are lifters who will use the thumbless grips despite the possible danger. 5. Be sure to have a spotter to help you whenever you lift a heavy weight. You never want to drop the bar on yourself. You also want to be able to max out and be able to recover when you no longer can lift the bar. A spotter will be able to help you recover from your final press. 6. Lift the bar up, slowly bring it down to just above your sternum, and explode upward for one rep. Pay attention to your form as you add more weight. It's easier to bend your wrists, bounce the weight off your chest, and exhibit other \"no-nos\" when trying to lift big. You'll gain more muscle and strength lifting the right form and lower weight than you will lifting with higher weight and the wrong form. Lifters generally do between 8 and 12 reps (also called \"repetitions\") and 3 to six sets (one set is the maximum numbers of reps you give yourself). 7. Drink plenty of water and take at least two minute breaks between each set. Water will help you stay hydrated and allow your muscles to function at high capacity, giving you an overall better workout. 8. Rest according to how you feel between sets. Some guides say the ideal rest time between sets is 90 to 120 seconds. While this is perhaps a good general guide for increasing muscle mass, it may not be ideal for you as an individual. You probably don't want to overshoot the 2-3 minute range, but you don't want to rush yourself into lifting thin. If your ultimate goal is gaining muscle and mass, you're going to want to shock your body. How you do this is up to you. It can mean cutting down on rest time, increasing poundage on lifts, supersetting, etc. As long as you manage to keep pushing your body physically, you will notice a difference.",

    "reference_text": "1. Lie on your right side on a yoga mat. You’ll be putting your weight on your feet and your elbow, so you’ll want something soft beneath you. Spread out so you’re lying on your right side on the floor. If you don’t have a yoga mat, try to do this exercise on carpet or a rug so you have a little bit of cushion beneath you. 2. Put your left foot on top of your right foot. Stick your legs straight out so they’re in line with your glutes, then stack your feet on top of each other. This will help you keep your body straight, so it’s super important! Your feet will be anchoring you to the ground, so it’s really important they stay steady throughout this exercise. 3. Push your right elbow underneath your right armpit. Spread your palm out wide to keep your balance. Your arm will be taking most of your weight, so really dig it into the floor to keep your balance. Make sure your right arm stays at a 90-degree angle from your torso the entire time. 4. Engage your core to lift your hips off the ground. To get into the plank position, squeeze your abs and your glutes tight. Lift your hips up off the ground until your body creates a slanted line from your head down to your feet. If you’re having trouble keeping your balance, place your left hand on your hip. Otherwise, keep it flat along your left side. Keep your hips in a straight line with the rest of your body—don't lift them up or let them sink down. [5] X Expert Source Laila Ajani Fitness Trainer Expert Interview 5. Hold the pose for 6 seconds, then lower your hips. When you’re first starting out, this pose might be tough to hold. Try to go for at least 6 seconds, then slowly lower your hips back to the floor. As you get better, you can try holding your side plank for up to 30 seconds at a time. If you’re having trouble, try exhaling as you lift your hips up and inhaling as you lower down. This will help you engage the right muscles so you can hold the pose for longer. 6. Repeat that 3 to 5 times, then switch to your left side. As you practice this more, you’ll be able to do more reps. When you first start out, try to do the pose 3 to 5 times, then roll over onto your left side and repeat. If you don’t feel exhausted by these reps, you can try doing a few more. On the left side, your left arm and left foot will be underneath your body. 7. Bend your knees if you’re a beginner. If you find the normal side plank to be a little too tough, get into a side plank position, but bend your knees to stick your feet out behind you. Engage your glutes to lift your hips off the floor, and use your knees instead of your feet to keep your balance. [9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source This is a good way to practice the side plank if you’re having trouble keeping your back straight. 8. Do leg raises to engage your obliques. Get into a normal side plank position. Keeping your spine straight, lift your top leg up toward the ceiling, taking it a little bit higher than hip height. Quickly lower your leg back down to complete one repetition. If you’re having trouble keeping your balance, place your outside hand on your hip to keep yourself steady. To really challenge yourself, try holding a dumbbell in your upper hand as you do your leg lifts. Try doing leg lifts 10 to 15 times on each side. 9. Try hip dips to strengthen your lower obliques. Get into a side plank position, then place your left hand on your hip. Slowly lower your hips down toward the floor, stopping just before they touch the ground. Quickly engage your abs to lift your hips back up again for one repetition. You’ll feel this in your abs, your glutes, and your obliques. It’s important to raise back up into a classic side plank position with your spine straight. That way, you won’t lose your posture throughout the exercise. If you’re having trouble with this exercise, do a side plank on your knees and try hip dips that way. Try doing hip dips for 15 to 30 seconds on each side. 10. Do a side plank crunch to work on your abs. Get into a side plank position and lift your hips up off the ground. Pull your upper leg and upper arm in towards your torso to do a crunch on that side of your body. Extend your arm and leg outwards to get out of the crunch and complete one repetition. If you feel yourself starting to rock back and forth, engage your glutes to hold yourself steady. Picture this like you’re doing a classic crunch, except now you’re on your side. Start out by doing crunches for 15 to 30 seconds on each side. 11. Work on your balance with an oblique twist. Lie on your side in a side plank position. Lift your hips off the ground, then put your outer hand up by your ear. Slowly turn in toward the floor, stopping yourself when you’re looking directly at your lower forearm. Twist back around to get into your side plank position. These twists engage your entire body, so they’re a great overall workout. Twist 10 to 15 times on each side. 12. Try a side plank slide to challenge yourself. Get into a side plank position. Slowly slide your feet outwards, keeping your spine straight and your weight on your elbow. Tilt your arm so it’s at an angle to work your obliques, then hold the pose for a few seconds. Engage your obliques to slide back upwards into a normal side plank. This move can be a little tough on your elbow, so put a pillow or a foam mat underneath your arm if you need to. Try to keep your spine straight the entire time to get the most out of this workout. Work up to doing slides for 15 to 30 seconds on each side.",

Lead with the inside foot up, drive hips back slightly, then bring the trail foot up. Step down the way you came.\n   * **Easier:** use the lowest step.\n   * **Harder:** pause for 1 second balanced at the top.\n\n4. **Incline Push-Ups — 2 sets of 8–12**\n\n   * Hands on a step (higher step = easier). Body in a straight line, elbows at ~45°. Lower chest toward the step; press back.\n   * **Easier:** move hands to a higher step.\n   * **Harder:** move to a lower step.\n\n5. **Incline Plank Step Taps — 2 sets of 20 alternating taps**\n\n   * Hands on a step in a strong plank. Lift one hand to tap the next higher step, place it back, then switch. Keep hips steady.\n   * **Easier:** widen your stance.\n   * **Harder:** slower tempo or tap two steps up.\n\n6. **Calf Raises — 2 sets of 12–15**\n\n   * Stand on the edge of a step holding the railing lightly. Drop heels slightly below the step, then rise onto the balls of your feet and pause.\n   * **Easier:** both feet.\n   * **Harder:** single-leg.\n\n7. **Toe Taps (Cardio) — 3 rounds of 30–45 sec, 15 sec rest**\n\n   * Rapidly tap the bottom step with alternating feet. Stay light and upright.\n   * **Easier:** slower pace.\n   * **Harder:** pump arms or extend to 60 sec.\n\n8. **Cool-Down (2–3 minutes)**\n\n   * **Calf stretch:** hands on rail, heel down on bottom step, 20–30 sec/side.\n   * **Quad stretch:** stand tall, hold the rail, pull heel to glute, 20–30 sec/side.\n   * **Hamstring stretch:** heel on step, hip hinge with flat back, 20–30 sec/side. Breathe slowly.\n\n# How to structure it\n\n* Do steps **2–7** as a circuit; rest **30–45 sec** between moves.\n* Complete **2–3 circuits** depending on time/fitness.\n\n# Form cues to remember\n\n* Tall chest, ribs down, and brace your core before stepping.\n* Knee tracks roughly over the second/third toe.\n* Move quietly—control down as much as up.\n* Stop if you feel sharp pain or dizziness; consult a pro if you have heart, balance, or joint concerns.\n\nIf you want, tell me your space (number/height of steps and any equipment) and I can tailor reps, progressions, and a weekly plan.\n",

Above that, lighter gases become more common (start of the **heterosphere**).\n* **Ionosphere:** Not a separate “layer” by altitude alone; it **overlaps** the mesosphere/thermosphere (\\~60–1,000 km) and is defined by ionization from solar radiation (important for auroras and radio).\n\nIf you’d like, I can add typical Celsius/°F scale values on the temperature curve or include example altitudes for planes, balloons, meteors, the ISS, and GPS satellites.\n",

As we breathe, oxygen enters the nose or mouth and passes the sinuses, which are hollow spaces in the skull. Sinuses help regulate the temperature and humidity of the air we breathe. The trachea, also called the windpipe, filters the air that is inhaled, according to the American Lung Association. It branches into the bronchi, which are two tubes that carry air into each lung. The bronchial tubes are lined with tiny hairs called cilia. Cilia move back and forth, carrying mucus up and out. Mucus, a sticky fluid, collects dust, germs and other matter that has invaded the lungs. We expel mucus when we sneeze, cough, spit or swallow.",

This is the **mucociliary escalator**.\n\n**3) What happens to the trapped stuff.**\n\n* When the mucus reaches the throat, you **swallow** it. Stomach acid and enzymes break down most contaminants.\n* If there’s a lot of irritation, sensors trigger a **cough or sneeze**, which blasts mucus and particles out.\n\n**4) Deep areas without cilia: the alveoli.**\n\n* The tiny air sacs (alveoli) handle gas exchange and **don’t have cilia**.\n* Here, roaming **alveolar macrophages** (patrolling immune cells) **eat** fine particles and microbes.\n* What they collect is carried away via the mucociliary escalator (after they crawl to ciliated regions) or through **lymphatic drainage**.\n\n**5) Size matters (where particles tend to land).**\n\n* **Large** (> ~10 μm): mostly stopped in the **nose/throat**.\n* **Medium** (~2.5–10 μm): settle in the **trachea/bronchi**, cleared by cilia.\n* **Fine** (< ~2.5 μm): can reach the **alveoli**, handled by macrophages.\n* **Gases/ultrafine** may be absorbed or exhaled.\n\n**6) When the system struggles.**\n\n* **Dry air, dehydration, smoking, or pollutants** can thicken or paralyze mucus/cilia.\n* Certain conditions (e.g., **asthma**, **chronic bronchitis**, **cystic fibrosis**, or **primary ciliary dyskinesia**) reduce clearance, so particles linger and infections are more likely.\n\n**Quick recap:** your airways trap particles in mucus, **cilia sweep** that mucus upward, and **cough/sneeze or swallowing** removes it; deep in the lungs, **macrophages** finish the cleanup.\n\nIf you’d like, I can add labels or callouts to the diagram tailored to a specific class level (middle school vs. college).\n",

If you already have a Google account, you’ll need to sign out before you can continue. 2. Click Create account . You’ll find this small blue link near the bottom of the page, next to the Next button. 3. Select your account type from the menu. A menu will pop up with a few options to choose from. Select either For my personal use , For my child , or For work or my business . If you’re trying to create a business account, you might want to consider signing up for a Google Workspace account instead. The process for creating a child’s account is very similar to creating a personal account for yourself. You’ll need to provide information such as your child’s name, birthdate, and desired email address. However, you’ll also need to sign in with your Gmail account to provide parental consent for their account. 4. Enter your first and last name. Type your first name into the \"First name\" text box, then enter your last name in the \"Last name\" box underneath it. You must enter a first name, but the last name is optional. If you're creating a Gmail account for a friend or a child, enter their information in the fields provided. 5. Enter your birth date and gender. On the next page, you’ll be prompted to provide your birthdate (month, day, and year) and gender. If you don’t identify as male or female, select Custom to see additional options. You can also select Rather not say . Click Next when you’re done. Google asks for your birthdate because some Google services have specific age requirements. Google may also use this information to personalize your experience. If you decide to provide your gender, Google will use this information to personalize your account—e.g., by using your preferred pronouns in text that refers to you. 6. Select or create a custom email address. On the next page, you’ll be offered some automatically generated email addresses based on your name. If you don’t want any of those, select Create your own Gmail address and type in your preferred username. You can use a combination of letters, numbers, and periods. This is the text that will appear before “@gmail.com” in your email address. Click Next when you’re done. You must enter a unique username that isn't being used by someone else. If it's taken, you'll see: That username is taken. Try another. If the username you want is taken, add a number at the end or change the spelling. Sometimes Google will reject a username if it’s extremely similar to one that somebody else is using (even if there are slight differences), if someone else had that username in the past and then deleted it, or if Google has reserved the name to prevent abuse or spam. 7. Enter and confirm your new password. Type your preferred password into the \"Password\" text box, then type the same password into the \"Confirm\" box underneath it. Check the Show password box to see what you are typing. Click Next when you’re done. These passwords must match before you can proceed. Make sure to use a strong password to avoid any unauthorized access to your account. 8. Enter a recovery email. Google will contact you at your recovery email address if something goes wrong with your new account—e.g. if you get locked out or Google detects unusual activity from your address. Click Next when you’re done. If you don’t have an alternate email, or if you’d rather set up recovery options later, click Skip . 9. Review your info and select Next . On the next page, you’ll see your new account name and email address. If it looks good, click Next . Otherwise, you can use your browser’s Back button to go back and make changes to the information you entered in the previous steps. 10. Agree to the Terms of Service. On the next page, you’ll be prompted to agree to Google’s terms and privacy policy. Once you’ve reviewed them, click I agree . If you change your mind, click Cancel instead. 11. Confirm your personalization options. A window will pop up asking if you want to agree to Google’s personalization options. Click Confirm to continue, or select More options to change your settings. 12. Customize your account settings. Once you verify your new address, you’ll be taken to the Google Account home page. From here, you can adjust settings such as: Your account recovery information. Add a recovery email here if you didn’t already, or add a phone number so you have two recovery options. Set a home address for a more personalized experience. For example, Google will show you weather reports and map results based on your address. Adjust your privacy and security settings and review privacy recommendations for your account. Add contacts or set up a family group. 13. Go to https://mail.google.com to access your Gmail. You should be automatically logged into your new account. If not, you’ll be prompted to sign in. The first time you visit this page, you’ll see options to customize your inbox, set a profile image, and add or import contacts. To write and send an email, click Compose in the top left corner. To see your emails, click the Inbox tab on the left side of the page. Use the tabs at the top of your inbox on the right to view different categories such as regular emails (in Primary ), marketing related emails (in Promotions ), or email notifications from various social media platforms (in Social ).

You can use this method to check your battery health on any iPad model, including iPad Pro and iPad Air. 2. Navigate to Privacy & Security . You will have to scroll a bit to find this option, as it's at the bottom of the section that begins with General . 3. Click on Analytics & Improvements . It's near the bottom of the screen. 4. Ensure Share iPad Analytics is toggled. If this setting isn't toggled on, your iPad will not generate the logs needed to decipher your battery health. If you just toggled this setting on now, you'll need to wait a minimum of 24 hours for your iPad to create the correct analytics log. 5. Click on Analytics Data . A list of logs should pop up. 6. Find the most recent Analytics log. You are looking for a log that is titled Analytics . The numbers after Analytics are a date, so select the one that is the most recent. Logs titled analyticsd.diskwrites will not work for this method. If you're on iOS 15 or earlier, the correct analytics log will be titled log-aggregated . 7. Copy the log into a text editor. You can use the Notes app on your iPad or you can export the log file to a computer. 8. Search for MaximumCapacityPercent . The number after that phrase is your current maximum battery capacity. This number is a percentage, so if your log gives you a 90 after this number, your battery capacity is at 90%. You can search the log by using Find in Note if you're using the Notes app. Find in Note is located under the three-dot menu in the upper right-hand corner. On a computer, you can use the Find function , which is available in most text editors by clicking Ctrl + F on Windows or Cmd + F Mac. 9. Search for CycleCount . The number after that phrase is the current battery cycle count. Every time your iPad battery is charged from 0 to 100, that counts as a cycle. Apple says that iPads should maintain about 80% of total battery capacity after 1000 cycles.",
