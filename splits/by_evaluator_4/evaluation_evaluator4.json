This forms the wrist of the glove. 3. 3. Erase the oval from the wrist. Then, enclose a rectangle across the wrist. 4. 4. Erase one side of the oval. Use overlapping curved lines to form the glove's thumb and mitten. Use short curved lines to draw a starburst pattern at the point where the two lines meet. 5. 5. Draw a second oval overlapping the first glove. Erase as necessary. 6. 6. Erase the top of the oval and sketch in a rectangular shape with rounded corners. It should overlap the first glove, so erase as necessary. This forms the wrist of the glove. Then, enclose another rectangular shape within the first. Draw curved lines across the base of the glove to indicate the curvature of the material. 7. 7. Erase the side of the oval. Outline the thumb and mitten of the glove using two overlapping curved lines. Use shorter curved lines to draw a starburst pattern at the point where the two lines meet. Then, draw a curved line from the wrist to this junction, indicating a seam. 8. 8. Draw a circle above the gloves. This will form the hook from which the gloves hang. Draw a \"U\" shaped line above it. Below it, extend two curved lines and double them back upon themselves. Then, draw pairs of lines from the hook to each glove. This represents the string used to hang the gloves. 9. 9. Detail the glove. Draw curved lines across the wrist and side of the glove to indicate wrinkles and seams. 10. Color your boxing gloves. They are typically red.",

Add a short horizontal line beneath each for the wrist opening.\n\n2. Cuffs\n   Turn each wrist line into a short “cuff cylinder”: draw a thin rectangle wrapping the base of each oval.\n\n3. Knuckle dome\n   Round the top of each oval into a smooth dome. Add a soft, shallow curve near the top front to suggest the knuckle ridge.\n\n4. Thumbs\n   On the inner side of each glove, attach a teardrop/bean shape for the thumb pad. Its tip points toward the knuckle ridge; its base connects near the cuff.\n\n5. Palm panel\n   Inside each glove, sketch a curved panel that starts under the thumb, swoops across the palm, and meets the cuff—this is the padded palm section.\n\n6. Clean silhouette\n   Trace a single confident outline around each glove (dome → front knuckle → thumb → palm → cuff). Erase construction lines.\n\n7. Details & seams\n   Add short dashed or stitched lines along the knuckle ridge, around the thumb base, and near the cuff edge. If you prefer laces, sketch a narrow opening on the front of one glove with an “X-X-X” lace pattern; otherwise add a simple strap rectangle.\n\n8. Overlap & depth\n   Decide which glove sits slightly forward. Thicken that glove’s outer contour a bit more and let it overlap the other to create depth.\n\n9. Shading\n   Pick a light source (e.g., top-left). Lightly shade the underside of the knuckle dome, the inner thumb curve, and the gap between gloves. Darken the cuff underside. Keep the top planes lighter.\n\n10. Highlights\n    Leave slim unshaded arcs along the upper knuckle and thumb to suggest glossy padding.\n\n11. Final linework\n    Go over the main contour with a steady, slightly thicker line; keep stitching and fold lines thinner so they read as surface detail.\n\n12. Color (optional)\n    Fill the gloves with a base color (classic red works well). Add a darker tone along the shaded edges and a lighter tint on top planes. Keep cuffs a touch darker than the glove body.\n\nWant the steps as a printable handout or in a different style (cartoon, realistic, vintage)? I can format that too.\n",

From each of these, draw a long curved line. The lines should be roughly parallel and \"S\" shaped. 4. 4. Use a curved line to enclose the end of the stem. Draw another curved line across it to give the tip of the stem an oval shape. Then, texture the stem with curved lines. Use additional short lines to begin enclosing the ribs visible behind the stem. 5. 5. Complete the pumpkin's ribs. Then, draw tendrils of vine terminating from the stem. Use long, curving, \"S\" shaped lines. 6. 6. Draw a leaf along the pumpkin vine. First, extend a curved line from the vine. This forms the leaf's stem and vein. Then, use a series of connected, curved lines to outline the body of the leaf. 7. 7. Continue to draw the body of the leaf on the opposite side of the vein. Then, draw secondary veins extending from the primary vein or midrib. 8. 8. Draw the remaining veins, and begin a second leaf. Again, use a curved line for the stem and a series of curved lines to sketch the outline of the leaf. 9. 9. Complete the leaf, erasing as necessary. Finish outlining the leaf, and draw the secondary veins. 10. Color your pumpkin. Traditionally, pumpkins are orange in color. They can also be yellow, brown, green, or white!",

Shape the top and bottom\n   Flatten the bottom with a shallow curve so it can “sit.” At the top, tuck the ribs slightly inward to form a little dip.\n\n5. Draw the stem\n   From the top dip, sketch a short, slightly curved stem (think a bent cylinder). Add a notch or two where it meets the pumpkin.\n\n6. Optional leaf & vine\n   Add a simple leaf beside the stem and a loose curly vine for character.\n\n7. Clean lines\n   Erase the original oval and any overlaps you don’t need. Thicken the outer contour slightly to make the form pop.\n\n8. Shade & color\n   Color the pumpkin a warm orange. Deepen the creases between ribs with a darker orange/brown, keep the front planes lighter, color the stem green-brown, and add a soft shadow under the pumpkin.\n\nQuick tips\n\n* Keep rib curves widest at the middle and narrower near top/bottom.\n* If it looks too round, widen the oval; if too flat, make it taller.\n* Highlights along one side instantly make it look glossy.\n",

In the lower half of the circle, draw a pie chart or Pacman shape - a circle with a missing triangular slice. What does a Pacman shape look like, exactly? Check out this Pacman pixel art . Below each eye, extend two curved lines. These are the snail's eyestalks. Then, connect the stalks with an overlapping curved line, contouring the snail's face. 2. 2. Continue the line of the face. This line should be long and wavy, outlining the bottom of the sticky, slimy foot. 3. 3. Draw another wavy line roughly parallel to the foot, allowing the lines to meet at a point. Draw two curved lines across the face, forming the smiling mouth and the chin. Place a short curved line at the corner of the mouth. 4. 4. Extend the remaining side of the head with a long curved line. Double the line back on itself at the end to begin constructing the base of the shell. Connect the tip of the foot to the shell with a curved line. 5. 5. Begin the spiral shape of the snail shell by drawing a large \"C\" shaped line. Connect it to the snail's head with a short line. 6. 6. Continue the line of the shell to enclose the circle. Continue the line past the point of completion to begin the spiral pattern. 7. 7. Continue the spiral-shaped line. 8. 8. Enclose partial circles all along the spiral line. Notice that the circles grow smaller near the inside of the spiral. 9. 9. Fill the snail shell with more circular spots. Color your cartoon snail. We've given ours a green and yellow body with a tan and brown spotted snail. 10. Throughout much of the world, garden snails are usually brown in color. But some snails - especially the ocean and marsh-dwelling snails - have vivid black-and-white patterns or unusually bright colors .",

For example, if you'll be cooking a 1 pound (450 g) box of pasta, get out a pot that's at least 4 US quarts (3.8 L) in size. Then, pour in enough water to come 2/3 up the side of the pot. If you use a pot that's too small, your pasta is more likely to clump together as it cooks. 2. Cover the pot and bring the water to a boil. Set the pot of water on the stove and put a lid on it. Turn the burner to high and let the water come to a boil. You'll know the water is boiling when you see steam escaping from under the lid. Covering the pot with a lid will make the water boil faster. 3. Add salt and 1 pound (450 g) of pasta to the boiling water. Once the water boils vigorously, remove the lid and add 1 tablespoon (17 g) of salt and 1 pound (450 g) of pasta. If you're cooking long noodles, such as spaghetti, that don't fit in the pot, wait about 30 seconds and then push them into the water using a spoon or pasta fork. The salt will season the noodles as they cook, which will give you flavorful pasta. If you're unsure how many servings of pasta to cook, check the side of the box for recommended serving sizes. 4. Set a timer for 3 to 8 minutes. Stir the noodles with a pasta fork to break the noodles up and leave the lid off the pot. Then, check the pasta package for a recommended cooking time and set a timer for the minimum time that's suggested. For example, if the box says to cook the noodles for 7 to 9 minutes, set a timer for 7 minutes. Thin pasta, such as angel hair, will cook faster than thick or long noodles, such as fettuccine or penne, which take closer to 8 or 9 minutes. 5. Stir the noodles occasionally as they boil. The water should continue to bubble as the pasta cooks. Stir it every few minutes to prevent the noodles from sticking together. If the water looks like it might boil over the sides of the pot, turn the burner down to medium-high. 6. Bite into a noodle to see if it's cooked enough for you. Carefully scoop a noodle out of the water when the timer beeps and set it aside to cool a little. Bite into the noodle to tell if it's still hard in the center or if it's as soft as you like. Most people prefer to cook pasta until it's al dente, which means it's still a little firm in the center. If the pasta is still too hard for your liking, boil it for another minute before checking it again.",

    "generated_text": "Here’s your **text guide**. The **visual guide** is attached above as an infographic.\n\n# Text Guide: How to Boil Pasta Perfectly\n\n1. Pick the pot + water\n\n* Use a big pot so pasta can move freely.\n* Water: **4–6 quarts (4–5.5 L) per 1 lb / 450 g** pasta.\n\n2. Salt like the sea\n\n* Add salt once the water is hot but before the pasta goes in.\n* Aim for **1–2% salinity** (about **1½–2 Tbsp kosher salt** or **1 Tbsp table salt** per 4–6 quarts). This seasons the pasta itself.\n\n3. Rolling boil first\n\n* Wait for a **vigorous, rolling boil (100°C / 212°F)** before adding pasta. Lids help you get there; remove the lid once boiling.\n\n4. Add pasta & stir early\n\n* Drop pasta in and **stir for the first 1–2 minutes** to prevent sticking, then stir occasionally.\n\n5. Cook to al dente (taste, don’t guess)\n\n* Start tasting **2 minutes before** the package’s low end.\n* Al dente = cooked through with a pleasant bite and no chalky center.\n\n6. Save some pasta water\n\n* **Reserve ½–1 cup** starchy water before draining. It helps sauces cling and lets you adjust thickness.\n\n7. Drain, don’t rinse\n\n* **Do not rinse** (you’ll wash off starch). Only rinse if making a **cold pasta salad**.\n\n8. Marry pasta with sauce\n\n* Finish pasta **in a pan with the sauce** for 1–2 minutes, loosening with splashes of reserved water and finishing with a knob of butter or olive oil if desired. Season to taste.\n\n9. Rest & serve hot\n\n* Let it sit **30–60 seconds** off heat to settle the sauce; plate immediately.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Timing Reference (start tasting early!)\n\n* **Fresh pasta (eggs)**: 2–4 min\n* **Dry thin long (spaghetti, linguine)**: 8–10 min\n* **Dry short (penne, rigatoni, fusilli)**: 9–12 min\n* **Thick/shape with ridges or whole wheat**: 11–13+ min\n* **Gluten-free**: often **less forgiving**—taste frequently in the last few minutes.\n\n---\n\n## Common Mistakes & Fixes\n\n* **Pot too small** → water cools off and pasta sticks. Use a larger pot.\n* **Under-salting** → flat flavor. Salt the water properly.\n* **Adding pasta before a full boil** → gummy texture. Wait for the rolling boil.\n* **Not stirring early** → clumps. Stir in the first 1–2 minutes.\n* **Overcooking** → mush. Taste early and often.\n* **Rinsing after draining** → sauce won’t cling. Don’t rinse unless for cold dishes.\n\n---\n\n## Pro Tips\n\n* For silky sauces, emulsify: **toss pasta + sauce + reserved water** over medium heat until glossy.\n* Cooking for later? **Undercook by ~1 minute**, then finish in sauce when reheating.\n* High altitude: water boils at a lower temp—**add a minute or two** and rely on tasting.\n\nIf you want, I can tailor the infographic for a specific pasta shape or serving size.\n",

    "question": "How to organize your closet? Provide illustrated steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Remove all of the clothes from your closet. Take all of your clothes off their hangers and out of any bins or drawers in your closet. Fold them in piles on the floor or on your bed. This includes your shoes as well. It may also include other accessories such as belts, scarves, purses, or ties. 2. Decide which clothes you will keep. You may have the urge to keep everything, or toss everything. But go through systematically and piece by piece to really scrutinize your clothing. What you want in your closet are clothes that you wear on a regular basis, that fit you and are functional, and fit in the space available. Does the item fit? Clothing in the closet should fit you properly, neither too loose nor too tight. It typically means it is comfortable, not pinching, clothing can button easily, and no red marks left on the skin. It may also mean letting go of items no longer in fashion, such as skin tight skirts you really should not wear to your professional job. It is usually best to let go of \"inspirational items\" such as the jeans you hope to someday fit back into; trends being what they are the item may well be out of fashion when you do lose the weight. One pair of \"fat pants\" may be OK to remind you of your weight loss accomplishment. If your weight is fluctuating up or down (such as in growing young adults, pregnant women, or dieters) this may be tricky. Still, get rid or store items that clearly do not fit you. Do I wear this? Have you worn the item in the last year? How often do you wear it: once a week or only once this year? If you have not worn the item in a long time, that may well indicate it is time to let go. Special use items may be OK to keep even if used only periodically. You might have a Christmas sweater, or interview outfit, or formal dress that isn't used often but still worth having available. Do I like this? If you really don't like an item, do not keep it. In general, do not hang onto items out of guilt--such as that shirt your father bought you but you just do not like. Do I have multiples of this? Work or school uniforms are one thing. But if you have seven black almost identical t-shirts, that might be a sign to let go of a few. Make a \"Keep\" pile for the clothes that you will keep and wear on a regular basis. 3. Decide which clothes you will store. You should store the clothes that you won't be wearing for a while because they aren't seasonally appropriate. If it's the middle of summer, you can store your winter sweaters and scarves, and if it's the dead of winter, you can store your tank tops and summer dresses. You can also store clothes that may have sentimental value for you, such as a shirt your grandmother knitted for you, or an old t-shirt from your high school tennis team that no longer fits. Try to keep the sentimental value clothes to a minimum, though. Clothes are meant to be worn, after all. Consider displaying beloved clothing instead of keeping them in your closet. Consider framing your prized concert T-shirt, or creating a shadow box of your Boy Scout uniform and awards, or make a T-shirt quilt of your old marathon shirts. When you're done sorting through the clothes you will store, put them in a plastic bin or a clear bag marked keep. You can either store them in the back of your closet, under your bed, or in a storage unit or a different part of your home if you have the room. 4. Decide which clothes you will donate or throw out. This is the hardest step, and the most important. If you want to have a truly organized closet, then your goal should be to get rid of as many items of clothing as possible. This doesn't mean you should throw out your favorite things - however, it does mean that you should take a long hard look to ask yourself which clothes you will actually ever wear again. If you haven't worn something in over a year and it has no sentimental value, it's time to donate it. If you have an item that is so worn, covered in moth holes, or faded that you and anyone else will never wear it again, then it's time to throw it out. If you have a few items of clothing that are just way too small, stop waiting for the day that they will fit and donate them. Donate all of the clothes you don't need that are in good condition, or give them to a sibling or friend. 5. Clean the inside of the closet. You should do this before you put back your clothes. Vacuum or sweep the floor, wipe the walls down with all-purpose cleaner, and sweep away any cobwebs that may have accumulated there. If you want to make any changes, such as painting the inside a different color or adding and removing some shelves, do it now. 6. Hang up your clothes and organize them. Try to hang up as many of your clothes as you can. This will make it easier for you to find your clothes and to conserve space. You should not only hang up your clothes, but you should also organize them in a particular way so you can easily find them whenever you need to. Here are some ways to organize the clothes you hang up: Organize your clothes by season. If you've stored away some of your seasonal clothes, organize your clothes by season just for half the year. If it's summer, hang up your summer clothes first, followed by your fall clothes. Organize your clothes by type. You can separate your tank tops, shirts, pants, skirts, and dresses. Organize your work and casual clothes. Separate your work clothes from your casual clothes so you can easily get dressed for work in the morning. Organize your clothes by how often you wear them. You can choose any method of organization, but hang up a few key items, like your favorite hoodie or the pair of jeans you wear all the time, in the most accessible place. If you really want to step it up a notch, you can use differently colored hangers to mark a different type of clothing. For example, you can hang your tops on pink hangers, or your work clothes on green hangers. Colour code your clothes. example in rainbow colours You can also think about installing another pole to hang up your additional clothes. 7. Put additional clothes in other parts of your closet. Once you've hung up all of the clothes fit on your pole, you should find other parts of the closet to store the rest of your clothes. The clothes that you put in the bins should be used less frequently than the clothes you hang up, or they should be clothes that don't need to be hung up, like your workout clothes. Here are a few ideas: Don't waste the space under your hanging clothes. Put a few plastic bins of clothes under the hanging clothing. If you have room for a dresser, consider putting one in your closet. It will save you time and space. Consider installing a closet organizer to find a more efficient way to store your remaining clothes . If you have overhead space, make the most of it. Use it to store bulky sweaters, sweats, and other items that are thick and easy to spot. 8. Organize your shoes. Your shoes may take up a lot of the space in your closet, so once you've chosen which shoes you will keep, it's important to make the most of your space by storing them in the most organized and efficient manner. Here are some ways to organize the shoes in your closet: Organize them by type. Separate your dress shoes, sandals, and boots. Organize them by how often you wear them. Keep your favorite pair of boots, flip-flops, or sneakers in the place with the easiest access. Invest in a shoe rack to place on the floor of your closet. This will make it much easier to find the pair of shoes you want. Try storing your shoes in your overhead space. This is another easy way to save space. If your closet has a door that opens instead of a sliding door, consider getting a hanging shoe rack. If you have a front hall closet, consider putting the shoes you wear the most often there instead to save space in your personal closet. 9. Organize any boxes in your closet. If your closet is big enough, then it's likely that you've stored things other than clothes in it, such as big boxes filled with mementos, old photo albums, and CDs you haven't seen for ten years. To finish organizing your closet, you should go through these old boxes to see what you should keep and what you should toss. Here's how to do it: Get rid of any papers or items you've kept for over a year that have no sentimental value. Consolidate the boxes to save closet space. If your closet is already cramped, consider putting some of the items in a different place, such as putting your old high school yearbooks on the bottom of your bookshelf. If you've been using cardboard boxes, trade them up for plastic bins. They will last longer and will be more visually appealing. Label the boxes or bins so you know what's in them next time you move or organize your things again. 10. Organize any additional items in your closet. Take the time to go through any additional items in your closet to make sure that you still need them and that the closet is really the best place for them. Here are some examples: If you find any towels, sheets, or blankets, put them in your linen closet. If you've had an old lawn chair or another piece of furniture you don't really need hanging out back there, it's time to throw it out. If you've had to pick up an item and spend at least fifteen seconds trying to figure out what the heck it is or why you would need it, it's time to throw it out. Make sure that all of the other items you find belong in the closet and not another part of your home. For example, if you find a box of light bulbs, a box of comic books, or a box of chocolate, ask yourself if those items wouldn't be more logically organized elsewhere. 11. Make your closet more visually appealing. Turn your creativity loose and think of ways to add pleasure to the routine of getting dressed and looking through your closet every day. If you spend more time making your closet look nice, then you will be less likely to let it get messy in the future. Paint your closet a soft pretty color. Add mirrors for sparkle. Hang jewelry and scarves where you can see them -- as long as they don't get in your way. Hang up a small poster or painting that makes you smile every time you open your closet. 12. Enjoy your newly organized closet. Take a step back and admire your hard work! Hopefully, your closet is organized now so that all of its contents are easy to find and its overall appearance is to your liking. If not, take a few more minutes to make any minor changes that still need to be made. From this point forward, try to keep your closet organized as you add to it, or remove and return its current contents. Doing so will prevent you from needing to do another large overhaul on your closet in the future.",

    "question": "How to clean a coffee maker? Provide illustrated steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Disassemble the coffee maker. Remove any parts that come off, such as the pot, the brew basket, and any other removable parts. These part should be cleaned separately from the rest of the coffee maker. 2. Wash the removable parts. Submerge the removable parts in warm, soapy water, and wash them using a dish rag. You can wash removable parts of your coffee maker the same way you would wash dishes. Glass pots can be very breakable. When washing your coffee maker's pot, treat the glass gingerly. Some coffee makers may have parts that can be washed in a dishwasher. Check the instructions manual, if you still have it. If you're unsure if your coffee maker can be washed in the dishwasher, err on the side of caution and hand wash it. 3. Wipe down the outside of the machine. Take a wet, soapy rag and give the outside of the machine a good wipe down. Wipe down the sides and remove any coffee grinds from the warming plate. When you're down, wipe off any soap suds with a clean, damp rag. 4. Reassemble your machine. After all the parts are dry, you can put your coffee machine back together. It is ready to use again. Make a habit of cleaning your coffee maker like this after each use. 5. Add a vinegar and water solution to your coffee maker. [4] X Expert Source Jonathan Tavarez Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview Make a mixture using 2 parts warm water and 1 part white vinegar. [5] X Expert Source Marcus Shields House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview The precise amounts will vary depending on the size of your coffee maker, but make roughly enough to fill the reservoir. Pour the mixture into the reservoir like you normally would with water when making coffee. 6. Let the coffee machine run half a brew cycle. [7] X Expert Source Jonathan Tavarez Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview Turn the coffee machine on. Keep an eye on it as it brews. Once about half the pot is full with the filtered vinegar/water mixture, turn the pot off. 7. Let the coffee maker sit for an hour. Set a timer for an hour. Let the coffee pot sit for this time frame. This will give the vinegar time to sit in the machine and clean out any mold. 8. Complete the brew cycle. After letting the coffee maker sit for an hour, turn the machine back on. Let it run the rest of the brew cycle. [10] X Expert Source Jonathan Tavarez Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview When done, all the vinegar/water mixture should be filtered into the pot. You can pour this mixture down the sink. 9. Run three brew cycles with plain water. Fill your coffee pot with clean water. Pour this into the reservoir and run a complete brew cycle. [12] X Expert Source Jonathan Tavarez Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview When it's done, pour the water out and run two more brew cycles with clean water. This should clean any vinegar out of your coffee maker. 10. Wipe down the coffee maker. After disinfecting the coffee maker, take a clean, damp rag. Wipe down the exterior of the machine to remove any dirt and debris. You should also make sure to remove coffee grinds from the warming plate. 11. Read your instruction's manual. If you still have the instructions manual, read it before cleaning your coffee maker. Most coffee makers can safely be cleaned with a vinegar/water mixture, but it's always a good idea to check first. [15] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source If you don't have the instructions manual, try looking up your model online. You may be able to find an instructions manual on the Internet. 12. Leave the reservoir lid open. Many people keep the reservoir lid closed. However, it's a good idea to leave it open when not in use. This will help dry out the machine, preventing mold and bacteria from growing in a moist environment. 13. Rinse the brew basket in the sink regularly. The brew basket is very susceptible to mold as it gets wet during the brewing process. Make sure you rinse out the brew basket after each use and make a habit of cleaning it each time you do dishes. This will keep your coffee maker mold and germ free.

Discard grounds and the paper filter.\n2. Wash the carafe, brew basket, lid, and reusable mesh filter in warm, soapy water; rinse and air-dry.\n3. Wipe the exterior and warming plate with a damp cloth; leave the lid open to dry.\n\n## Deep clean & descale (every 1–3 months, or ~every 40 brews)\n\n1. **Empty & prep:** Reassemble the empty basket; place the empty carafe on the plate.\n2. **Mix descaler:**\n\n   * Option A: Fill the reservoir with a **1:1 mix of white vinegar and water**.\n   * Option B (vinegar-free): **1–2 tsp citric acid per cup (250 mL) of warm water**, stir to dissolve, then fill the reservoir.\n3. **Start brew & soak:** Run a brew cycle until the carafe is **about halfway** full, then **pause** the machine for **30 minutes** to dissolve mineral buildup.\n4. **Finish brew:** Resume and complete the cycle; discard the hot solution carefully.\n5. **Rinse cycles:** Fill the reservoir with plain water and run **2–3 full cycles**, discarding each carafe, until there’s **no vinegar/citric smell**.\n6. **Detail clean:**\n\n   * Wipe the showerhead/spray arm and the area under the brew basket; use a soft brush or toothpick to clear clogged holes.\n   * Clean the carafe stains with a paste of **baking soda + a few drops of water**; rinse thoroughly.\n7. **Reinstall filter:** If you use a charcoal water filter, install a fresh one.\n\n## Safety & tips\n\n* **Never use bleach** or abrasive scrubbers inside the machine.\n* Hard water? Descale **monthly**; soft water can go **every 2–3 months**.\n* For **single-serve pod machines**, run a “brew” with no pod using the same descaling mix, then 2–3 water-only brews; also clean the pod needle with the manufacturer’s tool or a paperclip.\n\nIf you’d like, I can also generate a second illustration specifically for single-serve machines or espresso makers.\n",

    "generated_text": "Here’s the explanation (text), separate from the image above:\n\nCars can drive through the Chandelier Tree because a man-made tunnel was carved through the base of this very large coast redwood decades ago as a roadside attraction. The opening removes only a central portion of the trunk, leaving thick “legs” of wood on both sides. Like a stone arch, those side walls carry most of the compressive load down to the roots, so the trunk can still support itself.\n\nBiologically, coast redwoods are unusually resilient: most water and nutrient transport happens in a thin, living layer just under the bark (the cambium and outer sapwood). Even though the tunnel removes wood and bark at the opening, continuous living tissue remains around the sides and back of the trunk, so flow up and down the tree can continue. Redwood heartwood is rot-resistant and the species can compartmentalize wounds, helping the tree survive long term.\n\nTo protect it, the attraction limits traffic to small vehicles, one at a time and at very low speed, minimizing vibration and impact. Modern arborists would not create new “drive-through” trees today, but this one remains as a historic curiosity—surviving thanks to the combination of clever arch-like shaping and the redwood’s natural toughness.\n",

Choose the right heels\n\n* Pick a stable pair: block heel or wedge, 2–3 in (5–7.5 cm), secure ankle strap, good fit.\n* Add non-slip sole grips if the bottoms are slick.\n\n2. Prep & warm up (1–2 min)\n\n* Ankle circles (both directions), calf raises, gentle hamstring/calf stretch.\n* Check straps/buckles are snug.\n\n3. Posture setup\n\n* Stand tall: ears over shoulders, shoulders over hips, ribs stacked, neutral pelvis.\n* Engage your core lightly; look where you’re going (not at your feet).\n\n4. Start with short, quick steps\n\n* Keep strides small to stay balanced.\n* Aim for a light, quick cadence rather than long reaches.\n\n5. Soft forefoot landing\n\n* Touch down gently near the ball of the foot, then roll through—avoid stabbing the heel first.\n* Keep toes pointing forward; don’t let ankles collapse inward.\n\n6. Use compact arm swing\n\n* Elbows ~90°, swing close to the body to counterbalance without twisting your torso.\n\n7. Pick safe surfaces\n\n* Prefer smooth, dry, even ground.\n* Avoid grates, cobblestones, grass, wet tile, and steep slopes.\n* If you must cross hazards, slow to a walk.\n\n8. Braking & turning\n\n* To slow: shorten steps, keep torso tall, don’t lean back.\n* For turns: take several tiny steps (no sharp pivots on a planted heel).\n\n9. Emergency stop & recovery\n\n* If you wobble: plant both feet shoulder-width, knees soft, lower your heels toward flat, then reset.\n* If a heel catches: stop, step back out, don’t yank forward.\n\n10. Cool down & care\n\n* Walk it off for 30–60 seconds, stretch calves/arches.\n* Inspect tips/heel caps; swap to flats if feet feel fatigued.\n\n### Practice Drills (build skill before full running)\n\n* March in place in heels (30–60s).\n* Walk–jog intervals: 10–20m jog, 20–30m walk; repeat 4–6x.\n* Figure-8 weaving around two cones/chairs to train controlled turns.\n\n### Safety Notes\n\n* Running in heels increases risk of ankle/knee injury—only do brief sprints when necessary.\n* Never run in very high, narrow stilettos or loose shoes.\n* Carry foldable flats as a backup.\n\nIf you’d like, I can generate alternate visuals (e.g., a printable poster or a horizontal storyboard) or tailor the steps to your specific heel height.\n",

    "reference_text": "1. Hold the ball straight out in front of you so that it is at the height of your chest. Drop it and let it bounce. As the ball begins to descend after this bounce, kick it back up into the air. Try to kick it with your dominant foot hard enough that it reaches chest height. Try to kick the ball with your foot angled slightly upward. Make sure to kick the ball with your laces. Make sure that your laces are not double knotted at first. The ball may bounce off of your laces at a weird angle if your laces are tied in a large knot. If you deflate the soccer ball a little bit, you will reduce the intensity of its bounce. The ball will be easier to control and won’t go flying every time you miss a kick. Once you’ve mastered the technique of juggling, you should fully inflate your ball. Keep your ankle 'locked' so that it stays angled and strong. A wobbly ankle leads to a wobbly kick. 2. Keep your knees slightly bent. Doing this will help you have better control over the ball. Do not lock your knees. Keep the foot you are not kicking with (your controlling foot) flat and firmly planted on the ground. It is important to be balanced while juggling the ball. In between touches, it is risky but useful to try to re-balance yourself such that you can maintain control of how you hit the ball each time. Always try to stay balanced on your toes, ready to make quick movements. The biggest key to balancing is to keep your knees bent and your eyes on the ball. 3. Practice until you can easily and consistently catch the ball in front of your stomach. You should not have to lean or reach to catch the ball. Then do the same with your other foot. Keep in mind that juggling with your non-dominant foot will be harder. Keep at it! 4. Increase the number of times you let the ball bounce off your feet. Instead of catching the ball every time you kick it, kick it up into the air and as it falls, kick it up again rather than letting it bounce on the ground. Try to keep the ball under control. Focus on juggling with one foot until you feel confident, then switch to the other foot. Practice until you feel confident juggling with both feet. You can \"catch\" the ball on your foot with careful practice by cushioning the fall of the ball and holding it in place with your foot and shin.",

First touch (“pop”)\n\n* Drop the ball, let it bounce once.\n* Lift your dominant foot; toes slightly up, ankle locked.\n* Strike the bottom-center with your laces so it rises to about waist height.\n\n3. Catch & reset\n\n* After one pop, catch the ball with your hands.\n* Repeat until the touch feels consistent and the ball goes straight up.\n\n4. Two pops, same foot\n\n* Drop → bounce → pop → bounce → pop → catch.\n* Keep touches light, ball close to your body, tiny hop on your standing foot.\n\n5. Alternate feet with a bounce\n\n* Right foot pop, bounce, left foot pop, bounce, catch.\n* Keep the ball centered between your feet.\n\n6. Continuous (no bounce)\n\n* Pop with one foot and, before it drops too far, pop with the other.\n* Aim for knee-to-waist height; stay balanced with small, light hops.\n\n7. Add thighs\n\n* When the ball rises too high for your feet, cushion and lift with your thigh.\n* Keep knees level; hit the mid-thigh so the ball goes straight up.\n\n8. Mix surfaces & control\n\n* Combine feet and thighs in a rhythm (R foot → L foot → R thigh → L foot, etc.).\n* Keep your torso quiet, eyes on the lower half of the ball, ankle locked on every touch.\n\n9. Build consistency (mini goals)\n\n* 5 touches total → 10 → 20 without moving much from your spot.\n* Then try “weak foot only” sets.\n\n10. Quick fixes for common mistakes\n\n* Ball drifting forward: lean slightly over the ball; strike more under the center.\n* Spinning ball: hit with a firm, flat laces surface; avoid toe-poking.\n* Popping too high: relax and hit lighter; aim for consistent knee-to-waist height.\n* Chasing the ball: take smaller hops and keep it centered between your shoulders.\n\nWant a version that adds heading (forehead) or chest control next?",

    "question": "How to Do a Layup in Basketball? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Dribble close to the basket with your right hand. Since you're doing a right-handed layup, angle your approach toward the right side of the basket. You want to get close enough to have easy access to the basket, but not so close that you end up directly under it. Layups are often taken off of a running dribble. Practice approaching the basket slowly at first, and increase your speed once you've got the footwork down. You can do a right-handed layup if you're starting near the center or right side of the basket. If you're approaching the basket from the left, you'll want to do a left-handed layup. 2. Step toward the basket with your right foot. When you're just a few feet from the basket, take a step toward it with our right foot. Use this step to gain distance and position yourself within easy shooting range. Dribble the ball one last time just outside your right foot. 3. Jump off of your left foot. As soon as your left foot lands, use it to jump in the direction of the basket. Your body should be moving toward the basket, but don't lean forward. Ideally, you'll be positioned close enough to the basket that you can jump straight up to take your shot. As you jump, bring the ball out of the dribble to your chest to prepare for the shot. 4. Shoot with your right arm as you lift your right leg. As you jump, imagine a string attached to your right arm and your right leg. Move them at the same time as you shoot, as though someone were pulling upward on the string. Your right knee should be bent and pointed toward the basket while your right arm moves up to shoot the ball. Arch your arm toward the basket. Shoot with your elbow slightly bent, so that your arm looks like the neck of a swan. When you're doing a layup, the shooting technique is slightly different from that of a regular shot. Instead of using your left hand to steady the ball, you want to shoot the ball using only your right hand. This gives you more reach, and since you're so close to the basket that it's difficult to miss the shot, you don't really need your left hand to steady the ball. As you shoot, slightly rotate your wrist inward to give the ball a little bit of spin, rather than snapping your wrist forward as you would for a regular shot. The gentle spin will keep it from hammering off the rim or backboard with too much force. 5. Aim for the sweet spot on the backboard. One of the reasons a layup is such a sure bet is because you can always use the backboard to help ease the shot into the basket. When you're doing a right-handed layup, the sweet spot is slightly above the top right corner of the small square in the center of the backboard. This spot absorbs the impact of the ball and drops it right down through the net. You'll get two points no matter how you make your shot, but it's better to aim for the backboard instead of trying to just tip the ball over the rim. The backboard allows more room for error, but if you hit the rim funny the ball will bounce right out. There's nothing worse than missing a wide-open layup when you have full access to the basket, so work on hitting that sweet spot every time. 6. Practice until your muscles remember the movement. The layup is a fundamental basketball move that will become second nature after you practice it enough. You should get to the point where your body remembers what to do and you don't have to think about which foot to put forward and which one to jump off: you just do it. Do layups as part of every basketball practice . As you practice, you'll start to get a good sense for how fast to approach the basket and from what distance to begin your layup footwork and launch into a jump. Work on doing layups while you're being defended or off of a long pass.",

This slows the escape of heat to space and **warms the lower atmosphere and surface** until a balance is reached between incoming sunlight and outgoing infrared.\n\n**Without the natural greenhouse effect,** Earth’s average surface temperature would be about **−18 °C (0 °F)**.\n**With it,** the average is about **+15 °C (59 °F)** — warm enough for **liquid water, stable climates, and the ecosystems and agriculture** life depends on.\n\n> Note: Adding extra greenhouse gases (e.g., rising CO₂ and CH₄) **enhances** the effect, shifting the balance and driving **modern climate change**.\n\n---\n\n**Image:** A labeled infographic illustrating the steps above (Sunlight in, reflection, surface warming, infrared out, greenhouse gases re-emitting heat, and the −18 °C vs +15 °C note).",

Most ocean carbon is stored as bicarbonate/carbonate, buffering the atmosphere.\n3. **Biological pump:** Phytoplankton photosynthesize; part of their organic matter and the **CaCO₃ shells** from calcifying organisms sink, carrying carbon to the **deep ocean**. Much is respired at depth (CO₂ stored for decades–centuries) and later **upwells** back to the surface and air.\n\n## 3) Route from plant carbon → **fossil fuels** (slow cycle)\n\nOnly a tiny fraction of plant carbon escapes decomposition and fire:\n\n1. **Rapid burial in anoxic settings:** In swamps, peatlands, deltas, or marine muds, dead plant/algal matter is buried faster than it decays. Low oxygen slows microbes.\n2. **Diagenesis & maturation (heat + pressure + time):**\n\n   * **Terrestrial plants → peat → lignite → coal.**\n   * **Marine algae/zooplankton → organic-rich muds → kerogen → oil & natural gas.**\n3. **Geologic storage:** These hydrocarbons remain trapped in rocks for millions of years unless exposed, uplifted, or extracted.\n\n## 4) Weathering, rocks, and volcanoes (slow geologic loop)\n\n1. **Silicate weathering (atmosphere → rivers → ocean):** CO₂ in rainwater forms weak acid that weathers rocks; dissolved bicarbonate flows to the ocean.\n2. **Carbonate formation:** Marine organisms and chemistry turn bicarbonate into **limestone/dolomite (CaCO₃/MgCO₃)** that gets buried as rock.\n3. **Subduction & degassing:** Tectonics carry carbonates and organic sediments into the mantle; **volcanoes** and metamorphism return CO₂ to the atmosphere.\n\n## 5) Human accelerators\n\n* **Fossil fuel extraction & combustion → atmosphere:** Moves carbon from the slow reservoir (coal/oil/gas) to the fast one as CO₂.\n* **Cement production:** Releases CO₂ when limestone is calcined.\n* **Deforestation & land-use change:** Reduces photosynthetic uptake and releases stored biomass/soil carbon.\n* **Methane leaks & agriculture:** Add CH₄, which later becomes CO₂.\n* **Permafrost thaw/peatland drainage:** Frees long-stored organic carbon as CO₂/CH₄.\n* **Ocean uptake & acidification:** Extra atmospheric CO₂ drives more dissolution, shifting seawater chemistry and affecting calcifiers.\n\n## 6) Direct answers to your two “where does plant carbon go?” questions\n\n* **Into the atmosphere:** through plant/animal **respiration**, **microbial decay** (CO₂/CH₄), **fires**, and **human burning** of biomass or extracted fossil fuels.\n* **Into fossil fuels:** when dead plant (or algal) material is **rapidly buried in oxygen-poor sediments**, then **cooked by heat and pressure** for **geologic timescales**, transforming into **coal (mainly land plants)** or **oil/gas (mainly marine algae/zooplankton)**.\n\nIf you’d like, I can tailor a simpler “student cheat-sheet” version or add typical timescales and example environments for each arrow.\n",
