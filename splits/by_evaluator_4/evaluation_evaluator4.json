This forms the wrist of the glove. 3. 3. Erase the oval from the wrist. Then, enclose a rectangle across the wrist. 4. 4. Erase one side of the oval. Use overlapping curved lines to form the glove's thumb and mitten. Use short curved lines to draw a starburst pattern at the point where the two lines meet. 5. 5. Draw a second oval overlapping the first glove. Erase as necessary. 6. 6. Erase the top of the oval and sketch in a rectangular shape with rounded corners. It should overlap the first glove, so erase as necessary. This forms the wrist of the glove. Then, enclose another rectangular shape within the first. Draw curved lines across the base of the glove to indicate the curvature of the material. 7. 7. Erase the side of the oval. Outline the thumb and mitten of the glove using two overlapping curved lines. Use shorter curved lines to draw a starburst pattern at the point where the two lines meet. Then, draw a curved line from the wrist to this junction, indicating a seam. 8. 8. Draw a circle above the gloves. This will form the hook from which the gloves hang. Draw a \"U\" shaped line above it. Below it, extend two curved lines and double them back upon themselves. Then, draw pairs of lines from the hook to each glove. This represents the string used to hang the gloves. 9. 9. Detail the glove. Draw curved lines across the wrist and side of the glove to indicate wrinkles and seams. 10. Color your boxing gloves. They are typically red.",

Add a short horizontal line beneath each for the wrist opening.\n\n2. Cuffs\n   Turn each wrist line into a short “cuff cylinder”: draw a thin rectangle wrapping the base of each oval.\n\n3. Knuckle dome\n   Round the top of each oval into a smooth dome. Add a soft, shallow curve near the top front to suggest the knuckle ridge.\n\n4. Thumbs\n   On the inner side of each glove, attach a teardrop/bean shape for the thumb pad. Its tip points toward the knuckle ridge; its base connects near the cuff.\n\n5. Palm panel\n   Inside each glove, sketch a curved panel that starts under the thumb, swoops across the palm, and meets the cuff—this is the padded palm section.\n\n6. Clean silhouette\n   Trace a single confident outline around each glove (dome → front knuckle → thumb → palm → cuff). Erase construction lines.\n\n7. Details & seams\n   Add short dashed or stitched lines along the knuckle ridge, around the thumb base, and near the cuff edge. If you prefer laces, sketch a narrow opening on the front of one glove with an “X-X-X” lace pattern; otherwise add a simple strap rectangle.\n\n8. Overlap & depth\n   Decide which glove sits slightly forward. Thicken that glove’s outer contour a bit more and let it overlap the other to create depth.\n\n9. Shading\n   Pick a light source (e.g., top-left). Lightly shade the underside of the knuckle dome, the inner thumb curve, and the gap between gloves. Darken the cuff underside. Keep the top planes lighter.\n\n10. Highlights\n    Leave slim unshaded arcs along the upper knuckle and thumb to suggest glossy padding.\n\n11. Final linework\n    Go over the main contour with a steady, slightly thicker line; keep stitching and fold lines thinner so they read as surface detail.\n\n12. Color (optional)\n    Fill the gloves with a base color (classic red works well). Add a darker tone along the shaded edges and a lighter tint on top planes. Keep cuffs a touch darker than the glove body.\n\nWant the steps as a printable handout or in a different style (cartoon, realistic, vintage)? I can format that too.\n",

    "reference_text": "1. 1. Draw an oval or egg shape to create the first rib of the pumpkin. Then, enclose another curved shape alongside it to create a second rib. 2. 2. Continue using long curved lines to enclose rounded ribs until the pumpkin has a round, full shape. 3. 3. Draw the pumpkin's thick stem. Extend two curved lines from the top of the pumpkin. From each of these, draw a long curved line. The lines should be roughly parallel and \"S\" shaped. 4. 4. Use a curved line to enclose the end of the stem. Draw another curved line across it to give the tip of the stem an oval shape. Then, texture the stem with curved lines. Use additional short lines to begin enclosing the ribs visible behind the stem. 5. 5. Complete the pumpkin's ribs. Then, draw tendrils of vine terminating from the stem. Use long, curving, \"S\" shaped lines. 6. 6. Draw a leaf along the pumpkin vine. First, extend a curved line from the vine. This forms the leaf's stem and vein. Then, use a series of connected, curved lines to outline the body of the leaf. 7. 7. Continue to draw the body of the leaf on the opposite side of the vein. Then, draw secondary veins extending from the primary vein or midrib. 8. 8. Draw the remaining veins, and begin a second leaf. Again, use a curved line for the stem and a series of curved lines to sketch the outline of the leaf. 9. 9. Complete the leaf, erasing as necessary. Finish outlining the leaf, and draw the secondary veins. 10. Color your pumpkin. Traditionally, pumpkins are orange in color. They can also be yellow, brown, green, or white!",

    "reference_text": "1. 1. Begin the cartoon snail outline by drawing the snail's head. First, draw two circles. These will become the snail's eyes. Draw a curved line across each circle. In the lower half of the circle, draw a pie chart or Pacman shape - a circle with a missing triangular slice. What does a Pacman shape look like, exactly? Check out this Pacman pixel art . Below each eye, extend two curved lines. These are the snail's eyestalks. Then, connect the stalks with an overlapping curved line, contouring the snail's face. 2. 2. Continue the line of the face. This line should be long and wavy, outlining the bottom of the sticky, slimy foot. 3. 3. Draw another wavy line roughly parallel to the foot, allowing the lines to meet at a point. Draw two curved lines across the face, forming the smiling mouth and the chin. Place a short curved line at the corner of the mouth. 4. 4. Extend the remaining side of the head with a long curved line. Double the line back on itself at the end to begin constructing the base of the shell. Connect the tip of the foot to the shell with a curved line. 5. 5. Begin the spiral shape of the snail shell by drawing a large \"C\" shaped line. Connect it to the snail's head with a short line. 6. 6. Continue the line of the shell to enclose the circle. Continue the line past the point of completion to begin the spiral pattern. 7. 7. Continue the spiral-shaped line. 8. 8. Enclose partial circles all along the spiral line. Notice that the circles grow smaller near the inside of the spiral. 9. 9. Fill the snail shell with more circular spots. Color your cartoon snail. We've given ours a green and yellow body with a tan and brown spotted snail. 10. Throughout much of the world, garden snails are usually brown in color. But some snails - especially the ocean and marsh-dwelling snails - have vivid black-and-white patterns or unusually bright colors .",

    "question": "How to boil pasta perfectly? Provide a visual guide and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Fill a large pot about 2/3 full of water. Since the pasta needs lots of room to move around as it cooks, use a big pot. For example, if you'll be cooking a 1 pound (450 g) box of pasta, get out a pot that's at least 4 US quarts (3.8 L) in size. Then, pour in enough water to come 2/3 up the side of the pot. If you use a pot that's too small, your pasta is more likely to clump together as it cooks. 2. Cover the pot and bring the water to a boil. Set the pot of water on the stove and put a lid on it. Turn the burner to high and let the water come to a boil. You'll know the water is boiling when you see steam escaping from under the lid. Covering the pot with a lid will make the water boil faster. 3. Add salt and 1 pound (450 g) of pasta to the boiling water. Once the water boils vigorously, remove the lid and add 1 tablespoon (17 g) of salt and 1 pound (450 g) of pasta. If you're cooking long noodles, such as spaghetti, that don't fit in the pot, wait about 30 seconds and then push them into the water using a spoon or pasta fork. The salt will season the noodles as they cook, which will give you flavorful pasta. If you're unsure how many servings of pasta to cook, check the side of the box for recommended serving sizes. 4. Set a timer for 3 to 8 minutes. Stir the noodles with a pasta fork to break the noodles up and leave the lid off the pot. Then, check the pasta package for a recommended cooking time and set a timer for the minimum time that's suggested. For example, if the box says to cook the noodles for 7 to 9 minutes, set a timer for 7 minutes. Thin pasta, such as angel hair, will cook faster than thick or long noodles, such as fettuccine or penne, which take closer to 8 or 9 minutes. 5. Stir the noodles occasionally as they boil. The water should continue to bubble as the pasta cooks. Stir it every few minutes to prevent the noodles from sticking together. If the water looks like it might boil over the sides of the pot, turn the burner down to medium-high. 6. Bite into a noodle to see if it's cooked enough for you. Carefully scoop a noodle out of the water when the timer beeps and set it aside to cool a little. Bite into the noodle to tell if it's still hard in the center or if it's as soft as you like. Most people prefer to cook pasta until it's al dente, which means it's still a little firm in the center. If the pasta is still too hard for your liking, boil it for another minute before checking it again.",

This seasons the pasta itself.\n\n3. Rolling boil first\n\n* Wait for a **vigorous, rolling boil (100°C / 212°F)** before adding pasta. Lids help you get there; remove the lid once boiling.\n\n4. Add pasta & stir early\n\n* Drop pasta in and **stir for the first 1–2 minutes** to prevent sticking, then stir occasionally.\n\n5. Cook to al dente (taste, don’t guess)\n\n* Start tasting **2 minutes before** the package’s low end.\n* Al dente = cooked through with a pleasant bite and no chalky center.\n\n6. Save some pasta water\n\n* **Reserve ½–1 cup** starchy water before draining. It helps sauces cling and lets you adjust thickness.\n\n7. Drain, don’t rinse\n\n* **Do not rinse** (you’ll wash off starch). Only rinse if making a **cold pasta salad**.\n\n8. Marry pasta with sauce\n\n* Finish pasta **in a pan with the sauce** for 1–2 minutes, loosening with splashes of reserved water and finishing with a knob of butter or olive oil if desired. Season to taste.\n\n9. Rest & serve hot\n\n* Let it sit **30–60 seconds** off heat to settle the sauce; plate immediately.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Timing Reference (start tasting early!)\n\n* **Fresh pasta (eggs)**: 2–4 min\n* **Dry thin long (spaghetti, linguine)**: 8–10 min\n* **Dry short (penne, rigatoni, fusilli)**: 9–12 min\n* **Thick/shape with ridges or whole wheat**: 11–13+ min\n* **Gluten-free**: often **less forgiving**—taste frequently in the last few minutes.\n\n---\n\n## Common Mistakes & Fixes\n\n* **Pot too small** → water cools off and pasta sticks. Use a larger pot.\n* **Under-salting** → flat flavor. Salt the water properly.\n* **Adding pasta before a full boil** → gummy texture. Wait for the rolling boil.\n* **Not stirring early** → clumps. Stir in the first 1–2 minutes.\n* **Overcooking** → mush. Taste early and often.\n* **Rinsing after draining** → sauce won’t cling. Don’t rinse unless for cold dishes.\n\n---\n\n## Pro Tips\n\n* For silky sauces, emulsify: **toss pasta + sauce + reserved water** over medium heat until glossy.\n* Cooking for later? **Undercook by ~1 minute**, then finish in sauce when reheating.\n* High altitude: water boils at a lower temp—**add a minute or two** and rely on tasting.\n\nIf you want, I can tailor the infographic for a specific pasta shape or serving size.\n",

    "question": "How to organize your closet? Provide illustrated steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Remove all of the clothes from your closet. Take all of your clothes off their hangers and out of any bins or drawers in your closet. Fold them in piles on the floor or on your bed. This includes your shoes as well. It may also include other accessories such as belts, scarves, purses, or ties. 2. Decide which clothes you will keep. You may have the urge to keep everything, or toss everything. But go through systematically and piece by piece to really scrutinize your clothing. What you want in your closet are clothes that you wear on a regular basis, that fit you and are functional, and fit in the space available. Does the item fit? Clothing in the closet should fit you properly, neither too loose nor too tight. It typically means it is comfortable, not pinching, clothing can button easily, and no red marks left on the skin. It may also mean letting go of items no longer in fashion, such as skin tight skirts you really should not wear to your professional job. It is usually best to let go of \"inspirational items\" such as the jeans you hope to someday fit back into; trends being what they are the item may well be out of fashion when you do lose the weight. One pair of \"fat pants\" may be OK to remind you of your weight loss accomplishment. If your weight is fluctuating up or down (such as in growing young adults, pregnant women, or dieters) this may be tricky. Still, get rid or store items that clearly do not fit you. Do I wear this? Have you worn the item in the last year? How often do you wear it: once a week or only once this year? If you have not worn the item in a long time, that may well indicate it is time to let go. Special use items may be OK to keep even if used only periodically. You might have a Christmas sweater, or interview outfit, or formal dress that isn't used often but still worth having available. Do I like this? If you really don't like an item, do not keep it. In general, do not hang onto items out of guilt--such as that shirt your father bought you but you just do not like. Do I have multiples of this? Work or school uniforms are one thing. But if you have seven black almost identical t-shirts, that might be a sign to let go of a few. Make a \"Keep\" pile for the clothes that you will keep and wear on a regular basis. 3. Decide which clothes you will store. You should store the clothes that you won't be wearing for a while because they aren't seasonally appropriate. If it's the middle of summer, you can store your winter sweaters and scarves, and if it's the dead of winter, you can store your tank tops and summer dresses. You can also store clothes that may have sentimental value for you, such as a shirt your grandmother knitted for you, or an old t-shirt from your high school tennis team that no longer fits. Try to keep the sentimental value clothes to a minimum, though. Clothes are meant to be worn, after all. Consider displaying beloved clothing instead of keeping them in your closet. Consider framing your prized concert T-shirt, or creating a shadow box of your Boy Scout uniform and awards, or make a T-shirt quilt of your old marathon shirts. When you're done sorting through the clothes you will store, put them in a plastic bin or a clear bag marked keep. You can either store them in the back of your closet, under your bed, or in a storage unit or a different part of your home if you have the room. 4. Decide which clothes you will donate or throw out. This is the hardest step, and the most important. If you want to have a truly organized closet, then your goal should be to get rid of as many items of clothing as possible. This doesn't mean you should throw out your favorite things - however, it does mean that you should take a long hard look to ask yourself which clothes you will actually ever wear again. If you haven't worn something in over a year and it has no sentimental value, it's time to donate it. If you have an item that is so worn, covered in moth holes, or faded that you and anyone else will never wear it again, then it's time to throw it out. If you have a few items of clothing that are just way too small, stop waiting for the day that they will fit and donate them. Donate all of the clothes you don't need that are in good condition, or give them to a sibling or friend. 5. Clean the inside of the closet. You should do this before you put back your clothes. Vacuum or sweep the floor, wipe the walls down with all-purpose cleaner, and sweep away any cobwebs that may have accumulated there. If you want to make any changes, such as painting the inside a different color or adding and removing some shelves, do it now. 6. Hang up your clothes and organize them. Try to hang up as many of your clothes as you can. This will make it easier for you to find your clothes and to conserve space. You should not only hang up your clothes, but you should also organize them in a particular way so you can easily find them whenever you need to. Here are some ways to organize the clothes you hang up: Organize your clothes by season. If you've stored away some of your seasonal clothes, organize your clothes by season just for half the year. If it's summer, hang up your summer clothes first, followed by your fall clothes. Organize your clothes by type. You can separate your tank tops, shirts, pants, skirts, and dresses. Organize your work and casual clothes. Separate your work clothes from your casual clothes so you can easily get dressed for work in the morning. Organize your clothes by how often you wear them. You can choose any method of organization, but hang up a few key items, like your favorite hoodie or the pair of jeans you wear all the time, in the most accessible place. If you really want to step it up a notch, you can use differently colored hangers to mark a different type of clothing. For example, you can hang your tops on pink hangers, or your work clothes on green hangers. Colour code your clothes. example in rainbow colours You can also think about installing another pole to hang up your additional clothes. 7. Put additional clothes in other parts of your closet. Once you've hung up all of the clothes fit on your pole, you should find other parts of the closet to store the rest of your clothes. The clothes that you put in the bins should be used less frequently than the clothes you hang up, or they should be clothes that don't need to be hung up, like your workout clothes. Here are a few ideas: Don't waste the space under your hanging clothes. Put a few plastic bins of clothes under the hanging clothing. If you have room for a dresser, consider putting one in your closet. It will save you time and space. Consider installing a closet organizer to find a more efficient way to store your remaining clothes . If you have overhead space, make the most of it. Use it to store bulky sweaters, sweats, and other items that are thick and easy to spot. 8. Organize your shoes. Your shoes may take up a lot of the space in your closet, so once you've chosen which shoes you will keep, it's important to make the most of your space by storing them in the most organized and efficient manner. Here are some ways to organize the shoes in your closet: Organize them by type. Separate your dress shoes, sandals, and boots. Organize them by how often you wear them. Keep your favorite pair of boots, flip-flops, or sneakers in the place with the easiest access. Invest in a shoe rack to place on the floor of your closet. This will make it much easier to find the pair of shoes you want. Try storing your shoes in your overhead space. This is another easy way to save space. If your closet has a door that opens instead of a sliding door, consider getting a hanging shoe rack. If you have a front hall closet, consider putting the shoes you wear the most often there instead to save space in your personal closet. 9. Organize any boxes in your closet. If your closet is big enough, then it's likely that you've stored things other than clothes in it, such as big boxes filled with mementos, old photo albums, and CDs you haven't seen for ten years. To finish organizing your closet, you should go through these old boxes to see what you should keep and what you should toss. Here's how to do it: Get rid of any papers or items you've kept for over a year that have no sentimental value. Consolidate the boxes to save closet space. If your closet is already cramped, consider putting some of the items in a different place, such as putting your old high school yearbooks on the bottom of your bookshelf. If you've been using cardboard boxes, trade them up for plastic bins. They will last longer and will be more visually appealing. Label the boxes or bins so you know what's in them next time you move or organize your things again. 10. Organize any additional items in your closet. Take the time to go through any additional items in your closet to make sure that you still need them and that the closet is really the best place for them. Here are some examples: If you find any towels, sheets, or blankets, put them in your linen closet. If you've had an old lawn chair or another piece of furniture you don't really need hanging out back there, it's time to throw it out. If you've had to pick up an item and spend at least fifteen seconds trying to figure out what the heck it is or why you would need it, it's time to throw it out. Make sure that all of the other items you find belong in the closet and not another part of your home. For example, if you find a box of light bulbs, a box of comic books, or a box of chocolate, ask yourself if those items wouldn't be more logically organized elsewhere. 11. Make your closet more visually appealing. Turn your creativity loose and think of ways to add pleasure to the routine of getting dressed and looking through your closet every day. If you spend more time making your closet look nice, then you will be less likely to let it get messy in the future. Paint your closet a soft pretty color. Add mirrors for sparkle. Hang jewelry and scarves where you can see them -- as long as they don't get in your way. Hang up a small poster or painting that makes you smile every time you open your closet. 12. Enjoy your newly organized closet. Take a step back and admire your hard work! Hopefully, your closet is organized now so that all of its contents are easy to find and its overall appearance is to your liking. If not, take a few more minutes to make any minor changes that still need to be made. From this point forward, try to keep your closet organized as you add to it, or remove and return its current contents. Doing so will prevent you from needing to do another large overhaul on your closet in the future.",

As you go, drop items into: Keep / Donate / Tailor-Fix / Trash / Seasonal. Keep sentimental items in a separate small box.\n\n2. **Declutter Fast**\n   For each item ask: *Do I wear it? Does it fit? Do I love it?* If it fails 2+ questions, let it go. Put donations straight into your car or schedule a pickup.\n\n3. **Measure & Plan Zones**\n   Measure width, height to shelf, and depth. Sketch zones: **Long hang**, **Short hang (double rod if possible)**, **Shelves/Drawers**, **Shoes**, **Accessories**.\n\n4. **Choose the Right Tools**\n\n   * Hangers: one style for tops/bottoms, sturdy for coats.\n   * Shelves: add dividers for stacks.\n   * Bins: clear or labeled for accessories and off-season.\n   * Over-the-door/side-wall hooks for bags, hats, scarves.\n\n5. **Group by Category**\n   Tops → Bottoms → Dresses → Outerwear → Activewear → Accessories → Shoes. Keep sets (suit pieces) together.\n\n6. **Arrange Smart**\n\n   * **Frequency:** everyday items at eye/hand level; occasion or off-season up high.\n   * **Color order (light → dark)** within each category.\n   * Face items the same way; one item per hanger. File-fold tees in drawers.\n\n7. **Use Vertical Space**\n   Add a second rod for short items, under-shelf baskets, and stackable boxes on the top shelf. Use floor space for a shoe rack; store rarely used items highest.\n\n8. **Label & Maintain**\n   Label shelves and bins (e.g., “Sweaters,” “Gym,” “Bags”). Do a 5-minute tidy each week; do a seasonal swap twice a year.\n\n## Quick Layout Tips\n\n* **Tiny reach-in:** Double-rod 2/3 of the width; one narrow long-hang section; over-door hooks; under-bed box for off-season.\n* **Standard reach-in:** One long-hang, one double-hang, one shelf stack with dividers; 2–3 clear bins up top.\n* **Walk-in:** U-shape: long-hang on the shortest wall, double-hang on others; drawers/shelves in the center; island only if walk path remains ≥ 36\".\n\n## Maintenance Mini-Routine (10 minutes)\n\n* Return strays, re-fold one stack, re-set hangers to face forward, toss one item you won’t wear, and empty donation bag when it fills.\n\n---\n\n**Image:** I’ve generated an illustrated “Closet Organization in 8 Steps” poster separately for you to use alongside these instructions.",

    "question": "How to clean a coffee maker? Provide illustrated steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Disassemble the coffee maker. Remove any parts that come off, such as the pot, the brew basket, and any other removable parts. These part should be cleaned separately from the rest of the coffee maker. 2. Wash the removable parts. Submerge the removable parts in warm, soapy water, and wash them using a dish rag. You can wash removable parts of your coffee maker the same way you would wash dishes. Glass pots can be very breakable. When washing your coffee maker's pot, treat the glass gingerly. Some coffee makers may have parts that can be washed in a dishwasher. Check the instructions manual, if you still have it. If you're unsure if your coffee maker can be washed in the dishwasher, err on the side of caution and hand wash it. 3. Wipe down the outside of the machine. Take a wet, soapy rag and give the outside of the machine a good wipe down. Wipe down the sides and remove any coffee grinds from the warming plate. When you're down, wipe off any soap suds with a clean, damp rag. 4. Reassemble your machine. After all the parts are dry, you can put your coffee machine back together. It is ready to use again. Make a habit of cleaning your coffee maker like this after each use. 5. Add a vinegar and water solution to your coffee maker. [4] X Expert Source Jonathan Tavarez Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview Make a mixture using 2 parts warm water and 1 part white vinegar. [5] X Expert Source Marcus Shields House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview The precise amounts will vary depending on the size of your coffee maker, but make roughly enough to fill the reservoir. Pour the mixture into the reservoir like you normally would with water when making coffee. 6. Let the coffee machine run half a brew cycle. [7] X Expert Source Jonathan Tavarez Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview Turn the coffee machine on. Keep an eye on it as it brews. Once about half the pot is full with the filtered vinegar/water mixture, turn the pot off. 7. Let the coffee maker sit for an hour. Set a timer for an hour. Let the coffee pot sit for this time frame. This will give the vinegar time to sit in the machine and clean out any mold. 8. Complete the brew cycle. After letting the coffee maker sit for an hour, turn the machine back on. Let it run the rest of the brew cycle. [10] X Expert Source Jonathan Tavarez Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview When done, all the vinegar/water mixture should be filtered into the pot. You can pour this mixture down the sink. 9. Run three brew cycles with plain water. Fill your coffee pot with clean water. Pour this into the reservoir and run a complete brew cycle. [12] X Expert Source Jonathan Tavarez Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview When it's done, pour the water out and run two more brew cycles with clean water. This should clean any vinegar out of your coffee maker. 10. Wipe down the coffee maker. After disinfecting the coffee maker, take a clean, damp rag. Wipe down the exterior of the machine to remove any dirt and debris. You should also make sure to remove coffee grinds from the warming plate. 11. Read your instruction's manual. If you still have the instructions manual, read it before cleaning your coffee maker. Most coffee makers can safely be cleaned with a vinegar/water mixture, but it's always a good idea to check first. [15] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source If you don't have the instructions manual, try looking up your model online. You may be able to find an instructions manual on the Internet. 12. Leave the reservoir lid open. Many people keep the reservoir lid closed. However, it's a good idea to leave it open when not in use. This will help dry out the machine, preventing mold and bacteria from growing in a moist environment. 13. Rinse the brew basket in the sink regularly. The brew basket is very susceptible to mold as it gets wet during the brewing process. Make sure you rinse out the brew basket after each use and make a habit of cleaning it each time you do dishes. This will keep your coffee maker mold and germ free.

Discard grounds and the paper filter.\n2. Wash the carafe, brew basket, lid, and reusable mesh filter in warm, soapy water; rinse and air-dry.\n3. Wipe the exterior and warming plate with a damp cloth; leave the lid open to dry.\n\n## Deep clean & descale (every 1–3 months, or ~every 40 brews)\n\n1. **Empty & prep:** Reassemble the empty basket; place the empty carafe on the plate.\n2. **Mix descaler:**\n\n   * Option A: Fill the reservoir with a **1:1 mix of white vinegar and water**.\n   * Option B (vinegar-free): **1–2 tsp citric acid per cup (250 mL) of warm water**, stir to dissolve, then fill the reservoir.\n3. **Start brew & soak:** Run a brew cycle until the carafe is **about halfway** full, then **pause** the machine for **30 minutes** to dissolve mineral buildup.\n4. **Finish brew:** Resume and complete the cycle; discard the hot solution carefully.\n5. **Rinse cycles:** Fill the reservoir with plain water and run **2–3 full cycles**, discarding each carafe, until there’s **no vinegar/citric smell**.\n6. **Detail clean:**\n\n   * Wipe the showerhead/spray arm and the area under the brew basket; use a soft brush or toothpick to clear clogged holes.\n   * Clean the carafe stains with a paste of **baking soda + a few drops of water**; rinse thoroughly.\n7. **Reinstall filter:** If you use a charcoal water filter, install a fresh one.\n\n## Safety & tips\n\n* **Never use bleach** or abrasive scrubbers inside the machine.\n* Hard water? Descale **monthly**; soft water can go **every 2–3 months**.\n* For **single-serve pod machines**, run a “brew” with no pod using the same descaling mix, then 2–3 water-only brews; also clean the pod needle with the manufacturer’s tool or a paperclip.\n\nIf you’d like, I can also generate a second illustration specifically for single-serve machines or espresso makers.\n",

It was always accessible for maintenance and intentionally shaped to be navigable.\n* **Functional sculptures:** The helmet-like “warriors” are chimney stacks and ventilation towers; their sculptural forms also help manage wind and prevent back-drafts and rain ingress—so they’re both art and infrastructure.\n* **Structural logic below:** The varying roof levels follow the catenary-arch attic structure underneath, creating hills and dips that turn the roof into a walkable topography.\n* **Open to visitors today:** Railings, marked routes, and staffed entry make the space safely accessible as part of the La Pedrera museum experience, so visitors can explore the architecture and the city views.\n",

Keep gaze forward.\n\n3. **Press Up**\n\n* Drive the dumbbells **up and slightly back**, letting your head move a touch back so the bells travel close to your face.\n* Keep ribs from flaring; maintain tight glutes and abs.\n* Elbows stay under (or just in front of) the wrists—don’t let them flare wide.\n\n4. **Lockout**\n\n* Finish with arms straight, **biceps near ears**, shoulders down (no shrug).\n* Exhale at the top or through the sticking point. Pause briefly under control.\n\n5. **Lower**\n\n* Pull the weights back to shoulders on a controlled 2–3-second descent.\n* Keep torso tall; don’t lean back or arch.\n\n6. **Breathe & Repeat**\n\n* Reset your brace each rep. Perform 6–12 reps for hypertrophy or 3–6 for strength.\n* Stop 1–2 reps shy of form breakdown.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Tips\n\n* Start lighter than you think; build up in 2–5 lb jumps.\n* If your low back arches, **tighten abs and glutes** or switch to a half-kneeling stance.\n* Think “press the body **under** the bells” rather than pushing them far forward.\n\n### Common Mistakes → Fixes\n\n* **Flaring ribs / big back arch** → Squeeze glutes, exhale, knit ribs down.\n* **Bent-back wrists** → Stack knuckles over forearms; grip the handles firmly.\n* **Press path in front** → Aim slightly back at the top so bells finish over mid-foot.\n* **Shrugging** → Keep shoulder blades set down; don’t chase height with traps.\n\n### Variations\n\n* **Seated press** for more stability.\n* **Arnold press** for extra front-delt/rotation work.\n* **Single-arm press** to train anti-lean core control.\n\nStay smooth and pain-free—if you feel shoulder pinching, reduce range, rotate palms in, or stop.",

Tuck your head between your arms and curl your back forwards. As you get more comfortable with the position, you can start with your hands extended out in front of you. 3. Roll backwards. When your head hits the mat, tuck your chin and push the ground with your hands. Think about pushing your body away from the mat with your hands. Be sure to keep your shoulders and arms strong and close to your head. They are your point of strength. 4. Swing your legs over your head. Using the momentum of your legs and the strength of your arms, bring your legs over your head and your feet to the mat. You may have to use your core strength as well. Kick your legs to gain momentum, but squeeze your abs to pull your feet to the mat. 5. Stand up. Once your feet hit the mat, press against the mat with your hands, pushing your upper body up to follow your feet. You will be in a squat with your hands on the mat. Stand up from there, with your arms up. In order to practice for your back extension, you can practice ending in a pushup position instead of a standing position. When your feet hit the mat, press against the mat with your hands and use your ab muscles to straighten out into a plank position. Hold that position to build strength.",

Your torso should hinge freely at the hips.\n   * Lock your ankles under the pads with feet flat on the plate, legs straight but knees soft.\n\n2. **Starting position**\n\n   * Body in a straight line from head to heels; ribs stacked over pelvis.\n   * Cross arms over your chest (easiest). Keep neck neutral (gaze ~1–2 m ahead of the floor).\n\n3. **Brace**\n\n   * Inhale through the nose; lightly brace your abs and squeeze your glutes to set a neutral spine.\n\n4. **Lower (the hinge)**\n\n   * Hinge at the hips and **control** the descent. Let the torso tip forward while keeping your back neutral (don’t round).\n   * Stop when you feel a hamstring stretch or when your torso is slightly below parallel. Tempo idea: ~2–3 seconds down.\n\n5. **Pause**\n\n   * Brief 1-second pause at the bottom while staying tight; keep shoulders away from ears.\n\n6. **Raise**\n\n   * Drive your hips into the pad, squeeze glutes/hamstrings, and lift the torso until it’s **in line** with your legs.\n   * Exhale as you come up. Do **not** hyperextend or arch past straight.\n\n7. **Finish & repeat**\n\n   * Hold the top for half a second in neutral, then repeat for 8–12 smooth reps.\n\n**Progressions & variations**\n\n* Easier: hands on hips → arms across chest.\n* Harder: hands behind head → hold a light plate/dumbbell tight to chest.\n* Tempo challenge: 3–4 sec down, 2-sec pause at bottom, 1 sec up.\n* Range: only as deep as you can keep a neutral spine.\n\n**Common mistakes to avoid**\n\n* Rounding the lower back on the way down.\n* Throwing the torso/swinging to get up.\n* Hyperextending at the top (arching past a straight line).\n* Pad set too high (blocks the hips) or too low (digs into thighs).\n* Craning the neck up; keep it neutral.\n\n**Safety tips**\n\n* If you feel sharp pain (especially in the lower back), stop.\n* Keep motion at the **hips**, not by bending the spine.\n* Start with bodyweight and perfect control before adding load.\n\nIf you want, I can also give steps for a **flat-bench alternative** (no Roman chair) or tailor reps/sets to your program.\n",

    "question": "How to perform a deadlift with proper form? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Prepare the barbell. Place the barbell on the ground in front of you and add plates according to your strength and fitness level. If it is your first time performing the deadlift, start lighter. It is always easy to add weight later. You want to perfect your form before you test your physical limits. Secure the plates tightly onto the barbell with clips to keep them from slipping around. Beginners usually start lifting just the barbell, since a typical barbell weighs between 25 and 45 pounds on its own. In this case, you'll want to prop the bar up so it's as high on your shins as it would be if it had plates (approximately 6-8 inches). Otherwise, you'll be bending too far down to pull the barbell right off the floor and could injure yourself. When you prop the barbell, be carefully that it can't easily roll off. 2. Set your stance. Step up to the bar so that your feet are approximately shoulder width apart, your toes are pointing forward or slightly outward, and the barbell is at the midpoint of your foot (as if it's dividing the front and the back of your feet in half). 3. Sit back. Pretend there's a short stool behind you; bend your knees and hips and sit back as if you were going to sit on that stool, while you reach down to grab onto the barbell (hands shoulder-width apart). Actively push your knees out; don't let them collapse in. Keep your back straight so your spine is in a neutral position parallel to the floor. Hinge forward from your hips instead of bending from the waist. [1] X Expert Source Melody Sayers, MS, RD, NASM-CPT Registered Dietician & Personal Trainer Expert Interview Bend your knees and hips just enough to reach and grab onto the bar. This is the starting position for the deadlift. Your shins should be pretty vertical and touching the bar. This is a hard position to stay in. As you figure out your form and check all these criteria, sometimes you'll straighten your legs and allow your back to curve to take a little break from this position. If you watch people deadlift, you'll see them do this between deadlifts. Just make sure you get back into this position before you actually lift. 4. Check your grip. Grasp the barbell with your hands slightly more than shoulder width apart, just outside of your legs. Keep your arms straight. Your palms should face your body, and be equally far from the ends of the barbell. It's not uncommon for people to use a mixed grip as they move onto heavier weights, as it affords a stronger grip, but it's generally better to keep things simple as a beginner. For Olympic lifting, some people use the hook grip, which is more secure but is painful at first. It is similar to the overhand grip, except that instead of the thumb over the remaining fingers, it is hooked underneath them. The underhand grip alone is not recommended because it can lead to the rupture of bicep muscle and connecting tendons, especially in people who do not have full flexibility in the elbow joint. 5. Set your starting position. \"Setting\" here means creating tension in your body while you're in the starting position so you use your muscles when you pull the bar up. It's a bit like clenching your body; you don't want to be like a wet noodle at all because then you might pull a muscle or hurt a joint. Always make sure your back is completely flat and straight. Keep your head, shoulders, and back in alignment. [2] X Expert Source Melody Sayers, MS, RD, NASM-CPT Registered Dietician & Personal Trainer Expert Interview If there is any kind of bend in your back, you need to do some flexibility work before deadlifting. If you have someone record you in starting position, you'll be able to see whether your back is straight or not. Your hips should be above your knees and your shoulders should be above the hips while slightly over the bar. Engage your core and keep your weight heavy in your heels. [3] X Expert Source Melody Sayers, MS, RD, NASM-CPT Registered Dietician & Personal Trainer Expert Interview Make sure you are looking at the ground in front of you (about 45 degrees) to avoid strain on your neck when performing the lifting portion of the deadlift. 6. Stand up and bring the bar up with you. Raise your hips and shoulders at the same rate while maintaining a flat back. Keep your abs tight during the whole lift. Begin the movement by lifting the slack out of the bar. This is done by pulling the bar slightly up until you feel resistance. If you are using metal plates, you will hear a slight clanging noise. This engages all of the muscles prior to committing to the lift. Next, lift the weight while pushing through the middle of your foot, straightening your knees while pulling your shoulders and head back, and pushing your hips forward after the bar has reached just below the knee. The bar should drag along your shins on the way up--that's why a lot of people who deadlift wear pants or knee-high socks, and if they don't, they often have bruises or scrapes to show for it. Come to a standing position with upright posture and your shoulders pulled back (don't let your shoulders cave forward, think of always pinching your shoulders back together and sticking your chest up and out). Don't bend backwards at all, just stand up straight. Engage (squeeze) your hamstrings and glutes to pull the bar up. Avoid locking your knees. [4] X Expert Source Melody Sayers, MS, RD, NASM-CPT Registered Dietician & Personal Trainer Expert Interview 7. Lower the bar. Keeping your back straight, return the bar to the starting position in a controlled manner. Push your butt out as if you are going to sit down in a chair. Do not arch your back or curl your tailbone under. [5] X Expert Source Melody Sayers, MS, RD, NASM-CPT Registered Dietician & Personal Trainer Expert Interview Release the weight after it is on the ground. 8. Place two dumbbells on either side of your body. The dumbbells should be slightly in front of your feet. Make sure that the weight of your dumbbells is appropriate for your strength. 9. Position yourself properly. Your feet should be spread slightly wider than your shoulders. Point your toes forward. You could also point them slightly outward; the result will be the same. 10. Squat down and grasp the dumbbells. You should squat with a flat, neutral back. Make sure that your shoulders are pulled away from your ears. Keep your head in line with your spine, though if it more comfortable you can tilt your chin up slightly. Make sure that your gaze remains straight ahead (if your eyes wander, so will your head, which will in turn shift your spine.) Make sure that your chest is lifted. Make sure that your heels stay firmly on the floor, and that your shoulders are slightly in front of the balls of your feet. 11. Keep your core strong while you stand up. Your abs help stabilize your spine when you begin to lift the dumbbells. Straighten your knees and then your hips before coming to a fully upright position. Your elbows should be straight and the dumbbells should rest by your sides against your thighs. Your hips and shoulders should rise up and straighten at the same time. You should try to keep the dumbbells as close to your body as possible while you straighten up. 12. Hinge at the knees to lower the dumbbells back down. Your hips should move backwards and down as you begin to squat back down to the ground. Try to avoid bending your knees so that they are far ahead of your toes. Keep your back straight and avoid curling your tailbone in or arching your back. Make sure to keep your abs strong and engaged while you lower back down. Keep your shoulders back and lowered while you do this lift and squat.",

Above that, lighter gases become more common (start of the **heterosphere**).\n* **Ionosphere:** Not a separate “layer” by altitude alone; it **overlaps** the mesosphere/thermosphere (\\~60–1,000 km) and is defined by ionization from solar radiation (important for auroras and radio).\n\nIf you’d like, I can add typical Celsius/°F scale values on the temperature curve or include example altitudes for planes, balloons, meteors, the ISS, and GPS satellites.\n",

It’s not a “shared pair” (like in a covalent bond); it’s a non-directional Coulombic attraction between opposite charges.\n\n**How it forms in lithium fluoride (LiF):**\n\n1. **Start with neutral atoms**\n\n* Lithium (Li): 1s² 2s¹ → one valence electron.\n* Fluorine (F): 1s² 2s² 2p⁵ → seven valence electrons.\n\n2. **Electron transfer**\n\n* Lithium loses its single 2s valence electron:\n  Li → Li⁺ + e⁻\n* Fluorine gains that electron to complete an octet:\n  F + e⁻ → F⁻\n\n3. **Ionic attraction and crystal**\n\n* The resulting ions attract strongly: Li⁺ + F⁻ → **LiF(s)**.\n* In the solid, countless Li⁺ and F⁻ ions pack into a rock-salt lattice, where each Li⁺ is surrounded by six F⁻ (and vice versa). This **lattice energy** makes LiF very stable, hard, and high-melting.\n\n**Why it happens**\nLithium easily gives up its loosely held valence electron (low ionization of the outer electron), while fluorine strongly attracts an extra electron (high electron affinity). The large electronegativity difference drives electron transfer; the lattice’s electrostatic stabilization locks the ions into the solid.\n\n---\n\n*Image is shown above. (You asked for image and text separately, so the picture is separate from this explanation.)*",

Light from the **illuminator** is focused through the specimen by the **condenser**. The **objective** forms a **real, inverted intermediate image** inside the tube; the **eyepiece** then magnifies that into the **virtual image** you see.\n\n**Total magnification = (eyepiece power) × (objective power).**\n**Resolution** (smallest detail you can separate) improves with higher **NA** of the objective/condenser and with shorter wavelengths of light.\n\n## What each numbered part does (match to the image)\n\n1. **Eyepiece (ocular)** – Magnifies the intermediate image made by the objective; often 10×. Some models include a **diopter** ring to match focus between your eyes.\n\n2. **Head / Body tube** – Holds the optics at fixed spacing so the objective image forms at the correct plane for the eyepiece.\n\n3. **Revolving nosepiece (turret)** – Clicks different **objective lenses** into the light path quickly.\n\n4. **Objectives (4×, 10×, 40×, 100× oil)** – The primary magnifiers; also the main drivers of **resolution** and **working distance**.\n\n   * **4× (scanning):** wide field, easy to find the specimen.\n   * **10× (low):** more detail, still forgiving.\n   * **40× (high dry):** fine detail; use **fine focus only**.\n   * **100× oil:** highest detail; requires immersion oil to boost NA and resolution.\n\n5. **Stage** – Platform that holds the slide. Often a **mechanical stage** with **X–Y controls** for precise movement.\n\n6. **Slide & stage clips** – Secure the specimen directly over the light path.\n\n7. **Coarse focus knob** – Moves the stage quickly to find focus at low power.\n\n8. **Fine focus knob** – Small, precise motion for sharp focus, especially at 40×/100×.\n\n9. **Condenser** – A lens system that concentrates light onto the specimen; usually raised close to the underside of the slide for brightfield.\n\n10. **Iris diaphragm (substage)** – Adjustable aperture beneath the condenser. **Open** for brightness and resolution; **close** for more contrast (but less resolution). Use together with the condenser height.\n\n11. **Field diaphragm (if present)** – Controls the illuminated field size; helps set Köhler illumination and reduce stray light.\n\n12. **Illuminator / LED** – The light source. Often paired with a **brightness control** on the base.\n\n13. **On/Off & brightness control** – Powers the lamp and sets intensity to a comfortable, non-glary level.\n\n14. **Arm** – Structural support; the safe handle when carrying the scope (other hand under the base).\n\n15. **Base & power connector** – House the lamp and electronics; provides stability.\n\n### What’s happening to the image?\n\n* **Illuminator → condenser → specimen:** Light is focused into a cone that passes through the specimen. Transparent/colored areas transmit or absorb light differently, creating contrast.\n* **Specimen → objective:** The objective produces a **real, inverted** magnified image inside the tube.\n* **Objective image → eyepiece:** The eyepiece acts like a magnifier, creating a **virtual image** your eye focuses on.\n* **Result:** High magnification with limited depth of field; tiny focus adjustments and proper illumination are crucial.\n\nIf you want, I can make a printable one-page “How it works + parts” handout using this same diagram.\n",

It’s a two-part block:\n\n1. a **gated cross-attention (XATTN)** sublayer, and\n2. a **gated feed-forward (“DENSE”/MLP)** sublayer, each wrapped with pre-LayerNorm and residual connections.\n\n---\n\n## Inputs\n\n* **Text hidden states** (H \\in \\mathbb{R^{T\\times d}}): current LM token embeddings.\n* **Visual latents** (Z \\in \\mathbb{R^{M\\times d_v}}): a fixed set of tokens produced by the Perceiver Resampler from one or more images/video frames.\n* (Learned) **gating projections** that turn each token’s state into an element-wise gate.\n\n---\n\n## Step-by-step flow\n\n### 1) Gated Cross-Attention (XATTN)\n\n* **Pre-norm:** (\\tilde H = \\mathrm{LN}(H)).\n* **Cross-attention:** queries (Q) come from (\\tilde H); keys/values (K,V) come from (Z).\n  [\n  A=\\mathrm{MHA}(\\tilde H W_Q,\\; ZW_K,\\; ZW_V)\n    ]\n* **Gate the visual update:** compute a token-wise, channel-wise gate\n  [\n  g_x=\\sigma(\\tilde H W_{gx}+b_{gx})\\in\\mathbb{R^{T\\times d}},\n    ]\n  then modulate the cross-attn output and add residually: [\n  H^{(1)}=H + g_x \\odot A.\n    ]\n  The gate lets the layer learn **how much** each token should trust vision, often starting near “closed” so initial behavior matches the base LM.\n\n### 2) Gated DENSE (position-wise MLP)\n\n* **Pre-norm:** (\\hat H=\\mathrm{LN}(H^{(1)})).\n* **MLP/Dense:** (F=\\phi(\\hat H W_1 + b_1) W_2 + b_2) (with a standard nonlinearity (\\phi), e.g., GELU).\n* **Gate the MLP update:**\n  [\n  g_d=\\sigma(\\hat H W_{gd}+b_{gd}),\\qquad\n  H_{\\text{out}}=H^{(1)} + g_d \\odot F.\n    ]\n\n---\n\n## Why the gating?\n\n* **Stability with frozen backbones:** The LM (and typically the vision encoder) can remain frozen; new parameters are in the XATTN/DENSE paths and their gates. Gating prevents overwhelming the LM with visual signals early in training and enables smooth **modality balancing**.\n* **Token-specific control:** Gates are computed **per token** and **per channel**, so some words (e.g., nouns near image mentions) can open the visual pathway more than others.\n* **Regularization by design:** With gates near zero, the block reduces to an identity map, which curbs overfitting and preserves strong language priors.\n\n---\n\n## Placement in Flamingo\n\nThese Gated XATTN-DENSE blocks are **interleaved at several points** inside the LM stack. During inference on interleaved image–text streams, each text segment can query the relevant **cached** visual latents via the XATTN, while standard self-attention continues to handle language context.\n\n---\n\n## Summary of components\n\n* **LayerNorm (pre-norm)** before each sublayer\n* **Multi-Head Cross-Attention** (Q from text, K/V from visual latents)\n* **Learned sigmoid gates** (g_x, g_d) (element-wise modulation)\n* **Position-wise MLP (“DENSE”)**\n* **Residual connections** after both sublayers\n\nIf you’d like, I can annotate the diagram with your preferred symbols (e.g., different gate shapes, head counts, or exact tensor sizes) and export it as SVG or PDF.\n",

Open each category and set to **Off**:\n\n   * **Messages and calls** → toggle **Message requests**, **Messages**, **Group requests**, **Calls**, **Video chats** → **Off**.\n   * **Posts, stories and comments** → set items like **Likes**, **Comments**, **First posts and stories**, **Mentions**, etc. → **Off**.\n   * **Following and followers**, **Live and Reels**, **From Instagram**, etc. → set each to **Off** as desired.\n3. (Optional) Scroll to **Email/SMS** and turn those **Off** if you don’t want emails or texts from Instagram.\n\n## Option 3 — Silence Instagram completely at the phone level (recommended for zero alerts)\n\n### iPhone (iOS)\n\n1. Open **Settings** app → **Notifications** → **Instagram**.\n2. Toggle **Allow Notifications** **Off**.\n\n   * (Optional) Also turn off **Sounds**, **Badges**, and all alert styles.\n\n### Android (steps may vary slightly by device)\n\n1. Open **Settings** → **Apps** (or **Apps & notifications**) → **Instagram** → **Notifications**.\n2. Toggle **Show notifications** **Off**.\n\n   * (Optional) Leave it On and turn individual **Notification categories** Off for fine-grained control.\n\n---\n\n### Tips\n\n* To mute a single chat: open the DM, tap the chat name, toggle **Mute messages** and/or **Mute call notifications**.\n* If you use **Focus/Do Not Disturb** (iPhone) or **Do Not Disturb** (Android), you can silence all apps—including Instagram—during certain times.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me your phone type (iPhone or Android) and I’ll tailor these steps exactly to your model.\n\",",

    "reference_text": "1. Open your Settings app. The app has a gray icon with a gear on it. You can use this method to check your battery health on any iPad model, including iPad Pro and iPad Air. 2. Navigate to Privacy & Security . You will have to scroll a bit to find this option, as it's at the bottom of the section that begins with General . 3. Click on Analytics & Improvements . It's near the bottom of the screen. 4. Ensure Share iPad Analytics is toggled. If this setting isn't toggled on, your iPad will not generate the logs needed to decipher your battery health. If you just toggled this setting on now, you'll need to wait a minimum of 24 hours for your iPad to create the correct analytics log. 5. Click on Analytics Data . A list of logs should pop up. 6. Find the most recent Analytics log. You are looking for a log that is titled Analytics . The numbers after Analytics are a date, so select the one that is the most recent. Logs titled analyticsd.diskwrites will not work for this method. If you're on iOS 15 or earlier, the correct analytics log will be titled log-aggregated . 7. Copy the log into a text editor. You can use the Notes app on your iPad or you can export the log file to a computer. 8. Search for MaximumCapacityPercent . The number after that phrase is your current maximum battery capacity. This number is a percentage, so if your log gives you a 90 after this number, your battery capacity is at 90%. You can search the log by using Find in Note if you're using the Notes app. Find in Note is located under the three-dot menu in the upper right-hand corner. On a computer, you can use the Find function , which is available in most text editors by clicking Ctrl + F on Windows or Cmd + F Mac. 9. Search for CycleCount . The number after that phrase is the current battery cycle count. Every time your iPad battery is charged from 0 to 100, that counts as a cycle. Apple says that iPads should maintain about 80% of total battery capacity after 1000 cycles.",
