Then, Use a series of connected curved lines to draw the bushes and trees visible in the distance. 2. 2. Draw more shrubbery on the horizon using a series of connected curved lines. Then, draw a tree towering above the rest. Extend a pair of lines for the trunk, and use a curved line to enclose the tree's crown. 3. 3. Draw more trees on the horizon. Again, extend a pair of lines for the trunk, and use a curved line to enclose the tree's crown. 4. 4. Draw two large \"U\" shaped lines to outline the rainbow. Draw the sun peeking out from behind it. Use a curved line to enclose the partial circle at the center of the sun. Then, use a series of straight lines that meet at points to draw its zig zag-shaped rays. 5. 5. Draw \"U\" shaped lines within the rainbow, parallel to the outer lines, to demarcate the different colors. Then draw a daisy flower growing on the hillside. Start with an oval for the center of the flower, and \"U\" shaped lines for the petals. Draw a line below it to form the stem and a teardrop-shaped leaf on one side. 6. 6. Draw another daisy on the hillside. Again, start with an oval for the center of the flower, and \"U\" shaped lines for the petals. Nearby, draw a tulip using curved lines. Draw a line below each flower to form the stem, and a teardrop-shaped leaf on one side. 7. 7. Draw more tulips and daisies. Again, use an oval and \"U\" shaped lines for the daisy and curved lines for the tulip. Then, draw a line below each flower to form the stem and a teardrop-shaped leaf on one side. 8. 8. Draw another tulip, then some butterflies fluttering about. Use \"U\" shaped lines to form each of the butterflies' four wings. 9. 9. Complete your rainbow for kids outline by drawing clouds in the sky. Use a straight line for the bottom of each cloud and a series of curved lines for the fluffy top. 10. Color your cartoon rainbow for kids. Do you know the order of the rainbow's colors? You can remember them with the made-up name Roy G. Biv. Each letter stands for a color.

Then, shade a large round pupil inside each eye. Between them, draw an inverted teardrop shape. This is the owlet’s beak. Draw two short lines inside it to form the nostrils. Next, draw the fluffy feathers on top of the animal’s head. Use a series of short, curved lines that meet at jagged points. 2. 2. Draw a series of short, curved, connected lines above each eye. Use a similar series of lines - short ones that meet at gentle points - to outline the round, feathered face. Then, draw a series of lines that meet at points to outline the side of its round body. 3. 3. Use a series of curved lines that meet at jagged points to draw the opposite side of the baby’s body. Draw the owl’s legs, using long lines for the outsides, and connect them with a series of short lines. 4. 4. Texture the feathers of the owl’s chest using a series of short curved lines. Then, draw the bird’s foot. Draw three teardrop-shaped claws. Draw “U” shaped lines passing behind them to form the toes. 5. 5. Draw the owl’s remaining foot. Again, draw three teardrop-shaped claws with “U” shaped lines passing behind them to form the toes. Then, begin the second owlet. Draw the eyes, using two curved lines that don’t quite meet to draw each. Shade a large round pupil inside each eye. Draw a curved triangle between the eyes, forming the beak. 6. 6. Outline the feathery head using a series of short curved lines that meet at jagged points. Draw similar lines above the eyes. Draw a small nostril within the beak. 7. 7. Use a series of short, curved, jagged lines to draw the wing, and another for the belly. 8. 8. Draw the second owl’s feet. First, draw teardrop shapes for the six talons. Then, use curved lines to sketch the toes. 9. 9. Texture each owlet’s feathers with individual curved lines and connected lines in series. Notice the bellies, the base of the neck, and the area around the beak. 10. Your owl babies outline is now complete. Color your picture.

Add 2–3 rows of small “~” or “U” shapes for feathers.\n\n8. **Feet (and a branch, optional)**\n   Two stubby feet made of three rounded toes each (like a soft “W”). If you want, place them on a simple branch.\n\n9. **Clean line art**\n   Trace your favorite lines with a darker pen/marker. Erase all construction lines and overlaps.\n\n10. **Color**\n    Body: light–medium brown. Wings: darker brown. Belly: cream. Beak/feet: yellow-orange. Add a leaf on the branch for a pop of green.\n\n**Quick tips**\n\n* Keep lines light until the clean-up step.\n* If the owl looks grumpy, lift the inner top curves of the eyes a touch.\n* Big eyes and a small beak = cuter style.\n",

    "reference_text": "1. 1. Begin the fish tank outline by drawing a large rectangle. This indicates the front glass of the aquarium. On top of it, draw a long, narrow trapezoid. This forms the top of the aquarium and gives it a three-dimensional appearance. 2. 2. Begin creating the underwater scene . Draw small, round, irregular shapes in one corner to indicate a pile of pebbles. Then, draw a wavy curved line along the bottom of the tank, forming the ground or sediment. From the back corners of the trapezoid, extend vertical straight lines. These indicate the back corners of the aquarium. Notice that they don't go all the way down; the empty spaces will soon be filled with other objects. 3. 3. Draw the base of the aquarium. Use straight lines to draw the tops of the sides and the sides and bottom of the front. Then, draw a straight, horizontal line across the top of the base. 4. 4. Next, draw a castle for the fish to hide in. For the turret or tower, start with the triangle-shaped roof. Then, use curved lines for the sides, midsection, and the \"U\" shaped windows. Use curved lines to draw the central section of the castle, noting the large \"U\" shaped door. Texture the castle with full and partial rectangles, simulating bricks. 5. 5. Draw a watchtower at the top of the castle. Use small trapezoids to create the raised sections of the parapet. Connect them with curved lines, fully enclosing the castle. Then, begin drawing coral. Use curved lines to enclose the branching, tree-like shape. Finally, sketch sand along the side of the aquarium using a curved line. 6. 6. Complete the coral, using curved lines. Texture it with small \"C\" shaped lines. Then, draw the sediment at the back and side of the fish tank using a long curved line. 7. 7. Draw a plant or seaweed. For each leaf, extend two curved lines upward from the sediment. Allow them to cross back and forth over one another, enclosing several segments, before they finally meet at a point. Use curved lines to enclose and texture a seashell , as well as texturing the sand. 8. 8. Introduce the fish into their new home! Use curved lines to sketch the fish's mouth, eye, pectoral fin, body, tail, and dorsal fin. Texture the fins with curved lines. Then, draw a few circular bubbles so that the fish has plenty of air to breathe. 9. 9. Complete your fish tank outline by drawing the final fish. Follow the same steps as with the previous fish. Enclose a few more bubbles, then use wavy lines to sketch a rectangular shape at the top of the tank. This is the waterline. 10. Color your cartoon aquarium. We've shaded the aquatic residents orange to indicate that they are goldfish .",

Define glass edges\n\n* Darken the outer edges you want visible.\n* Keep the far back edges lighter or dashed so it still reads as glass.\n\n3. Add the waterline\n\n* Draw a horizontal line a bit below the top rim, slightly wavy for realism.\n* Show the line on the side planes too so it wraps around in 3-D.\n\n4. Pour in substrate\n\n* From the bottom back corner, sketch a gentle mound toward the front.\n* Keep edges soft; it’s sand or gravel.\n\n5. Place hardscape\n\n* Add a few smooth rocks (ovals) and a piece of driftwood (bent cylinder).\n* Overlap shapes to create depth.\n\n6. Plant it\n\n* Draw simple leaf clusters: long tapered leaves for vallisneria; bushy ovals for small plants.\n* Vary heights and angles.\n\n7. Add a fish\n\n* Start with an almond/teardrop body, triangle tail, small dorsal and pelvic fins.\n* Place one fish near the middle so it’s easy to see. Add a tiny circle eye and a small mouth.\n\n8. Equipment & bubbles\n\n* Sketch a heater or filter as a slim rectangle on a back corner.\n* Add a few bubbles rising from the substrate or filter.\n\n9. Clean-up & line weight\n\n* Erase construction lines that pass through the fish and foreground objects.\n* Thicken the front rim and foreground objects slightly; keep far edges thin.\n\n10. Shine & texture (optional color)\n\n* Add a thin highlight along the front glass edge and a couple of soft vertical streaks.\n* Dot the gravel, add light shading under rocks/plants, and, if coloring, keep water pale blue and glass mostly white with subtle reflections.\n\nWant another version (cartoony, realistic, or top-view aquascape)?

    "reference_text": "1. Preheat your oven to 375ºF (190ºC). 2. Grease and line a 9×9 in. (23 x 23 cm.) baking tray about an inch deep. You can also line the pan with aluminum foil, if you like. If you don't have anything to line the tray with, grease the tray with butter and add a light layer of flour over. 3. Melt the butter or margarine in a small pan over low heat. While this is melting, complete the next two steps. It should take about a minute or two for the butter to melt. It'll melt faster if you start off with it at room temperature. 4. Mix the caster sugar and eggs in a separate bowl. Pour the sugar and eggs into a medium-sized bowl and stir the ingredients together until they're fully incorporated. This should take about a minute. You can use a wooden spoon, a whisk, or even an electric mixer to stir the ingredients together. 5. Mix the flour and chocolate powder together in a separate bowl. Now, pour these ingredients into a separate bowl and stir them until they are fully incorporated. 6. Pour the melted butter into the sugar and egg mixture. Then, stir until the butter is well mixed in. This will make a nice, light yellow, creamy mixture. 7. Sift in the cocoa mixture into the egg mixture a little at a time. Just pour the ingredients into a sieve and gently shake it to let the air in while the cocoa mixture falls down into the egg mixture. You can even lightly scrape a fork along the bottom of the sieve to help sift the cocoa mixture. 8. Add the chocolate chips into the mixture. Now, you can mix in the chocolate chips into the rest of the ingredients. You can use regular chocolate chips, or cute mini chips if you prefer that. If you're feeling adventurous and want to mix things up, you can also go for the white chocolate chips. [ citation needed ] 9. Pour the mixture into the baking tray. Now that the tray is greased, it should be all ready for you to pour in the mixture. Use a flat plastic mixer or knife to even out the mixture. It doesn't have to be perfectly even, but try to distribute it around the pan as evenly as you can so that the brownies are of even height throughout. [ citation needed ] 10. Insert the tray on the middle shelf of the oven and bake for 30 minutes. After 25 minutes, keep checking on the brownies to make sure they don't burn. You can even clean up while you're waiting for your brownies to cook. If you hang around the kitchen while the brownies begin to harden, you'll be craving this sweet treat even more! 11. Remove the brownies from the oven and let them cool. Wait at least five minutes for the brownies to cool. This will also give them time to harden a bit. If you cut into them when they're still cooling, it'll be harder to cut them cleanly. 12. Cut the brownies into bite-size chunks. You can cut tiny pieces, so you can devour them in one bite each. You can also cut larger brownies, so each portion is nice and hearty. It's up to you -- if you're making them for a large event, then the smaller, the better. But if you're just cooking for yourself and a few friends or family members, why not cut them to be a little bigger? You can even top them with confectioner's sugar for an extra sweet taste.",

Prep\n   Heat oven to **350°F / 175°C**. Line pan with parchment, leaving overhang.\n\n2. Melt\n   In a saucepan over low heat, melt **butter**. Stir in **sugar** until glossy and warm (about 1–2 min). Remove from heat; cool 2–3 min until just warm.\n\n3. Whisk wet\n   Whisk in **eggs** one at a time until smooth and shiny, then whisk in **vanilla**.\n\n4. Combine dry\n   In a bowl, whisk **flour, cocoa, salt** (and baking powder if using).\n\n5. Make batter\n   Stir dry ingredients into the warm butter-egg mixture just until no dry spots remain. Fold in **chocolate chips/nuts** if using. Batter will be thick.\n\n6. Pan\n   Scrape batter into the lined pan and smooth the top.\n\n7.

    "reference_text": "1. Wash your hands before cleaning your glasses. Wash up for 20 seconds with lotion-free soap and warm water. You’ll need to make sure your hands are free of dirt, grease, and grime before cleaning your glasses. 2. Rinse your glasses with warm water. Run a gentle stream of tap water over your glasses. Rotate them to wet both sides of each lens, the frame, and earpieces. Hot water is bad for lenses, protective coatings, and the frame, so be sure to use warm water. 3. Use your fingertips to carefully lather them with dish soap. Add a small drop of lotion-free dish soap to each lens. Make gentle circular motions with your fingertips to lather the soap over both sides of your lenses, around the frame, and down each earpiece. 4. Clean the nose pads with a cotton swab or soft toothbrush. Use gentle pressure as you scrub the nose pads and the crevices between them and the frame. If you’re using a toothbrush, make sure it’s soft-bristled. Avoid grazing the lenses with the toothbrush, even if it’s soft-bristled. If there’s buildup between the lenses and the frame, use a cotton swab to loosen it. 5. Wash away soap residue. Hold the glasses under running water again to rinse away soap suds. Make sure you’ve washed away all traces of soap, as any remaining residue will cause smudges. 6. Shake off excess water and make sure your lenses are clean. Turn off the water, then give your glasses a careful shake. Check the lenses to make sure they’re clear, and wash them again if you see any smudges. 7. Dry your glasses with a microfiber cloth. Fold a clean microfiber cloth over both sides of a lens. Make soft circular motions with your fingertips to dry it, then repeat on the other lens. Wipe the nose pads, then use the cloth to dry and polish the frame and earpieces. [6] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source 8. Spray your glasses liberally with eyeglass cleaner. Spray cleaners for eyewear are available at pharmacies and eyewear retailers. If you can’t get to a sink and dish soap, spray your glasses with lots of cleaner to flush away dirt and debris. Some eyewear manufacturers and optometrists also offer free samples of spray cleaner. If you have anti-reflective (AR) glasses, make sure the cleaner you use is labelled safe for the AR coating. 9. Wipe away the cleaner with a microfiber cloth. After spraying your glasses, carefully wipe off excess cleaner. Fold the cloth over both sides of each lens, and make gentle circular motions with your fingertips to absorb the cleaner. Then use the cloth to dry the frame and earpieces. 10. Touch up your lenses with disposable eyeglass wet wipes. You can also clean your glasses with wet wipes when you’re on the go. Gently blow on them to remove dust and dirt, then gently rub them with a wet wipe using soft, circular motions. After cleaning them, dry them with a microfiber cloth. Only use wet wipes labelled for cleaning eyewear. If you have AR glasses, make sure your wipes are labelled safe for the AR coating. 11. Clean your glasses every morning and as needed. Make cleaning your glasses part of your morning routine. Check them regularly throughout the day, and touch them up as needed. Keeping your glasses clean and smudge-free will help prevent scratches. 12. Store your glasses in a hard case when you’re not wearing them. Don’t just throw your glasses in your purse or bag, and avoid placing the lenses on hard surfaces. When they’re not in use, keep them in a hard-shell case. The case should fit your glasses; if it’s too big, they might roll around and get damaged. [11] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source 13. Wash your microfiber cloths frequently. Microfiber cloths collect grease and dirt, so you should wash yours after 2 or 3 uses. Some cloths are machine washable, so check the care instructions and launder them as directed. [12] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source If your cloth isn’t machine washable, or if you’re not sure, hand wash it with dish soap, wring it out, then let it air dry. 14. Don’t wipe your glasses with your shirt, tissue, or a paper towel. Shirts, tissues, and paper towels contain fine debris that could scratch your glasses. Additionally, never wipe your glasses when they’re dry, or you’ll risk damaging them. Exhaling on your glasses and wiping them with your shirt might be convenient, but that’s a quick way to scratch up your lenses. Need help keeping your glasses clean?

    "reference_text": "1. A mild cleanser cleans skin gently without irritation. No matter what skin type you have, for daily cleansing, pick a face wash that’s fragrance- and alcohol-free. Using cleansers that are too harsh can strip your skin of its natural oils, leading to breakouts and dry skin. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source First, figure out what skin type you have , then check out our cleanser recommendations below: For oily or acne-prone skin: Oil-free cleanser (that won’t clog pores) [2] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source For dry skin: Hydrating cleanser (to moisturize while you wash) For combination or normal skin: Gentle foaming cleanser (to cleanse dirt and grime gently) For sensitive skin: Fragrance-free cleanser (to avoid irritating skin) For aging skin: Gentle cleanser (to cleanse dirt and grime without drying) 2. Take off your makeup to avoid clogged pores. Face cleansers are meant to cleanse your skin, not remove makeup. If you like to wear makeup during the day, use a gentle makeup remover on a cotton pad to take everything off before washing your face. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you have acne-prone or oily skin, go for a water-based makeup remover (instead of an oil-based one) to avoid clogged pores. 3. Use lukewarm water to gently wet your skin. Hot water strips your skin of its natural oils, and cold water doesn’t remove dirt and grime effectively. Turn your tap to a temperature that’s just above room temp, then splash your face with water. If you have long hair, pull it back into a bun or ponytail before you start washing your face. This will make it much easier to cleanse your skin. 4. Gently apply face wash to your skin in a circular motion. Pour a coin-sized amount of cleanser onto your hands, then rub your palms together to lather it up. Rub the cleanser all over your face, including your cheeks, nose, forehead, chin, and jawline for about 10 seconds. Using a washcloth or a cleansing device to wash your face might sound like a good idea, but actually, they can be too harsh on your skin. For daily cleansing, just use your hands. Don’t use cleanser around your eyes. The skin there is so delicate that it rarely needs cleansing—just splashing the area with water will do. 5. Be gentle with your skin as you rinse and dry to avoid irritation. Use lukewarm water again, and splash it onto your face to rinse off the cleanser. Grab a clean towel and pat your skin dry, trying not to rub or scrub your face. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Rubbing your skin with a towel can be irritating, which can lead to dry skin or acne breakouts. Be sure to dry your skin with a clean towel. Using a dirty towel can introduce bacteria into your skin, which can lead to clogged pores. 6. Use toner to tackle red marks or dark spots. Using a toner is totally optional, and not everyone needs one in their skincare routine. However, using a toner can help smooth out your skin tone and complexion. To add a toner to your skincare routine, pour a pea-sized amount onto a cotton swab and gently rub it into your skin right after cleansing. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For oily or acne-prone skin: Cleansing toner (to prevent breakouts) For dry skin: Hydrating toner (to moisturize throughout the day) For combination or normal skin: Toner with witch hazel and aloe (to smooth skin and close the pores) For sensitive skin: Soothing toner (for hydration without irritation) For aging skin: Toner with vitamin C (to hydrate and plump skin) If you use serums, acne cream, or other products on your skin, now is the time to apply those as well. 7. Apply moisturizer to lock in hydration after cleansing. Washing your face is very drying, and all skin types need some moisture afterward. Find a moisturizer that’s for your skin type, then rub moisturizer all over your skin with your fingertips.

Cleanse your skin in the morning and at night to keep it clean. Experts recommend washing your face 2 times per day, or after you sweat. This will help keep your skin clean and avoid oil-buildup and breakouts. [11] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Overwashing your face can be just as damaging as not washing it enough. Although it might seem like a good idea to cleanse your skin more often throughout the day, your face needs its natural oils to function. Try to stick to washing once in the morning and once at night for the best results. If you feel like your skin needs a refresh during the day, splash it with lukewarm water and then pat your face dry. This will help wipe away any excess oil or grime on your skin. Don’t feel like you need to include a whole slew of products in order to have a great routine. Try adding in products one at a time to figure out what works best for you! Reader Poll: We asked 871 wikiHow readers about what products make up their daily skincare routine, and 56% of them shared that they use just water and maybe one product . [Take Poll] 9. Exfoliating removes dead skin cells and opens up your pores. Over-exfoliating can be drying and can lead to breakouts, so try to exfoliate instead of washing your face no more than once a week. To exfoliate, wet your skin with lukewarm water, then gently rub a chemical exfoliant or a physical exfoliant onto your skin. Rinse your skin with lukewarm water, pat it dry, then follow up with a moisturizer. [12] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Chemical exfoliants are better for dry or sensitive skin, and physical exfoliants are better for normal or oily skin. Exfoliating is very drying, so always follow up with a moisturizer afterwards. 10. Use sunscreen to prevent dark marks and hyperpigmentation. An important part of your skin care routine is using SPF 30 or higher sunscreen every day. Apply it after your moisturizer and before your makeup (if you wear it) to protect against UV rays when you head outside. Make sure to reapply your sunscreen every 2 hours, or as often as the bottle tells you to. If you have oily skin, look for an oil-free sunscreen to avoid clogged pores or breakouts. For all other skin types, look for a sunscreen that’s formulated for your face. Remember, UV rays are always there, even on cloudy days! Sunscreen will protect your skin even when you can’t see the sun.",

Wash your hands\n   Gets dirt and oils off so you don’t rub them onto your face.\n\n2. Remove makeup / heavy sunscreen (PM)\n   Use micellar water or a cleansing balm/oil. Rinse if the product calls for it. If you wore long-wear makeup or water-resistant SPF, do a gentle second cleanse with your regular face cleanser.\n\n3. Wet your face with lukewarm water\n   Not hot (can strip) or icy (can irritate).\n\n4. Apply cleanser (nickel-size)\n   Pick one for your skin type:\n\n* Oily/combination → gel/foaming, non-comedogenic\n* Dry → cream/milk\n* Sensitive/rosacea-prone → fragrance-free, very gentle\n* Acne-prone → salicylic acid (0.5–2%) a few times/week if tolerated\n\n5. Massage 30–60 seconds\n   Use soft circular motions with fingertips. Cover T-zone, along hairline, around nose, and jawline. Don’t scrub or use harsh brushes.\n\n6. Rinse thoroughly\n   Lukewarm water until the slip is gone—residue can cause dryness or breakouts.\n\n7. Pat dry with a clean towel\n   Blot, don’t rub. Reserve a small towel for your face only.\n\n8. Moisturize within 1–2 minutes\n   Seal in moisture while skin is still slightly damp.\n   Morning: finish with broad-spectrum SPF 30+ (last step).\n   Night: use your treatment (e.g., retinoid) before or after moisturizer per product directions.\n\n## Extras & good habits\n\n* Frequency: 2× daily (AM & PM). After sweaty workouts, rinse or do a gentle cleanse.\n* Exfoliation: 1–3×/week max. Prefer gentle chemical exfoliants (AHA/BHA). Avoid daily harsh scrubs.\n* Water temp: lukewarm always.\n* Tools: keep headbands and towels clean; replace frequently.\n* Common mistakes to avoid: over-cleansing, using body soap on face, scrubbing red/irritated skin, skipping SPF in the morning.\n* If you have prescriptions or a diagnosed skin condition, follow your clinician’s plan and slot those products in as directed.\n",

    "generated_text": "Text (explanation):\n\nSingapore’s Helix Bridge looks like DNA because its main structure is literally two spiraling steel “ladders” that wrap around the walkway like a double helix. Short cross-members link the pair of spirals at regular intervals—just like DNA’s “base pairs”—and lighting emphasizes the twist so the pattern reads clearly, especially at night.\n\nIt can still carry crowds safely because that DNA form isn’t just decoration; it’s a working spatial truss. Here’s how it holds up the deck:\n\n* Two opposite helices share the load. One spiral primarily takes compression in some segments while the other takes tension; together they brace each other against buckling and twisting.\n* Radial struts connect the deck to the helices, so the walkway’s weight (and people on it) is transferred into the surrounding tube network rather than a single beam.\n* The helical tubes form closed, triangulated paths for forces, which is very efficient. Loads flow through the tubes to a series of piers in the bay, so the bridge is supported in stages rather than by one long, bending span.\n* Stainless-steel tubes provide high strength relative to weight and resist corrosion in the marine environment, keeping the structure stiff and durable.\n* The geometry also resists side winds and footfall vibrations, and the deck has full-height guardrails and non-slip surfacing for safety.\n\nIn short: the bridge reads as DNA because its load-bearing skeleton is a pair of intertwined steel helices with “rungs”—the same elements that make it strong enough for pedestrians.\n\n(Generated photo provided above.)\n",

The public route—marketed as “Up at The O2”—is a purpose-built, slightly springy tensile walkway laid over the dome. Visitors step on this walkway, not on the delicate membrane roof.\n • Supported by the arena’s structural skeleton. The walkway is cable-hung and bracketed back to the O2’s primary structure (the steel perimeter ring, radial cables, and the iconic yellow masts). This means the loads from groups of people are carried by the steelwork and cables designed to handle them.\n • Non-slip, flexible deck. The deck uses a high-friction, weather-resistant surface with just enough give to accommodate the dome’s curvature and wind movements without damaging the underlying roof.\n • Continuous fall-arrest system. Each climber wears a harness clipped to a continuous safety rail along the route, with handlines and occasional steps at steeper sections—so people remain secured the entire time.\n • Controlled capacity and guided access. Group sizes, pacing, and weather checks are managed by guides, keeping live loads within the design limits and ensuring safe operation.\n\nIn short, a separate, engineered walkway—suspended and anchored to the O2’s main steel-and-cable frame—plus a clip-in safety system makes it possible for visitors to walk over the dome safely.",

    "question": "How to Hold a Ping Pong Paddle? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Fit the blade of the paddle in the space between your thumb and index finger. If you look at your hand you’ll see the “V” shape that your thumb and index finger form. Place the paddle in your hand and move it so that its inside right bottom edge rests in that “V”. 2. Wrap your middle, ring, and pinky fingers around the handle. These are the only fingers you use to hold the ping paddle handle with a shakehand grip. These fingers should look similar to how they look when you’re shaking someone’s hand. Try moving the paddle up and down in a hand-shaking motion to the feel for this grip. 3. Rest your index finger against the outside of the paddle. Again, think of shaking someone’s hand. Your index finger is usually pointed outwards instead of curled in. This will help stabilize the paddle when you swing. If it feels more comfortable, let the tip of your finger rest against the side edge. 4. Curl your thumb around the front of the handle if you want greater wrist flexibility. This is called a shallow shakehand grip, and it's probably the most natural grip for beginners. It’s great for high freedom of movement for the paddle, which will make returning the ball easier. While this grip is usually pretty natural feeling, if it doesn't feel right to you, that may be a sign to try something else. 5. Rest your thumb against the front face of the paddle if you want a firmer grip. While this deep shakehand grip limits wrist flexibility, it works well for precise shots that don’t need a lot of power. Holding your paddle this way will also make it easy to switch the paddle from side to side, so it's great for both forehand and backhand shots. You can always switch between this thumb position and wrapping your thumb around the handle to get the benefits of both! 6. Keep your grip loose. Of course you want to grip the paddle firmly enough so it doesn’t fly out of your hand when you play, but a person should still be able to grab the paddle from you with only slight resistance. A too-tight grip will limit wrist flexibility too much making it difficult to hit or spin the ball. The paddle should feel like a natural extension of your arm, moving as freely as you move your hand. 7. Hold the paddle so its edge is perpendicular to the ground. You’ll notice your wrist tilts slightly downward. While the angle of the paddle will shift as you play, you want your wrist to stay in this position. Avoid floppy wrists when you swing! This will lead to you mis-hitting the ball. You need your entire forearm to swing and if you move your wrists around too much they’ll get tired. 8. Rest the handle in the space between your thumb and index finger. See the “V” shape formed by your thumb and index finger. With the handle angled upwards, rest its edge inside that “V” the way you would a pen. 9. Grip the handle between your thumb and index finger. Form a loop around the handle. Imagine writing with the paddle like a pen or pencil, and try moving it around in a pen writing motion to get a feel for the grip. 10. Keep your remaining fingers relaxed if you want greater wrist flexibility. For the Chinese penhold grip, lightly grip the outside face of the paddle with the tips of your middle, ring, and pinky fingers. Keep your fingers in a relaxed position. Holding the paddle this way will give you a wide range of motion and make it easy to block and push the ball. This grip makes it hard to consistently use backhand topspin or the spinning of the ball using the outside part of the paddle. 11. Straighten your middle, ring, and pinky fingers for more powerful strokes. For the Korean/Japanese penhold grip, the edge of your middle finger should lightly grip the outside face of the paddle with your ring and pinky stacked on top of it. You want your fingers to be rigidly straight. Holding the paddle this way will let you easily return a ball when standing far away from the table. Straight fingers can restrict paddle blade movement, making it harder for you to switch the paddle angle to reach the ball. 12. Use the “V” grip for high power and ball spin. Hold the blade of the paddle between your index and middle finger, forming a “V” shape. Place your thumb where it feels most comfortable. This grip ideal for wide-angle shots. Keep in mind that isn’t as popular as the penhold or shakehand grip, so finding a coach that specializes in it can be hard. 13. Block effectively with the Seemiller grip. Wrap your fingers around the handle of the paddle and rest your index finger on its back face as close to the bottom edge as you can get it. Use your thumb to grip the paddle blade with your index finger from the other side. Since backhand wrist flexibility is limited for this style, you may want to make backhand shots using the forehand side of your paddle. 14. Achieve heavy topspin with the reverse penhold grip. Hold the paddle handle between your thumb and index finger and rest your remaining three fingers against the paddle's outside face, keeping them relaxed. Angle the paddle in your hand slightly up so you can use both sides of the paddle to hit the ball. This grip is very similar to other penhold grips. The difference comes down to the angle you hold paddle and your style of play, and it's not unusual to see this grip combined with the Chinese or Korean/Japanese penhold styles.",

    "generated_text": "Here are your step-by-step **text instructions** (the visual is provided separately above).\n\n# Shakehand grip (most common)\n\n1. Start neutral\n   Hold the handle like a handshake. Keep your wrist relaxed and the blade (paddle face) roughly vertical.\n\n2. Thumb & index placement\n   Rest your **thumb lightly on the forehand rubber** near the handle. Lay your **index finger across the backhand rubber**, roughly horizontal. They should form a soft “V” along the top of the handle bevel.\n\n3. Wrap the other fingers\n   Curl the remaining three fingers around the handle. Leave a small gap (about a fingertip) between your palm and the handle’s butt—no choking up, no palming the blade.\n\n4. Set pressure points\n   Apply gentle pressure mainly with **thumb and index**. Keep the other fingers loose so the wrist can move freely.\n\n5. Angle for strokes\n   For **forehands**, let the index side relax so the blade can close slightly. For **backhands**, add a touch more pressure with the thumb to open the blade. Adjust in millimeters, not inches.\n\n6. Quick checks\n   Blade makes ~90° with your forearm at rest; wrist feels free; you can wiggle the blade without it slipping.\n\n# Penhold grip (popular in East Asia)\n\n1. Pinch the neck\n   Pinch the front of the blade with **thumb and index** as if holding a pen. The “circle” they form sits just above the handle.\n\n2. Rear-finger support\n   Place the **other three fingers on the back** of the blade. Beginners usually “fan” them; some players “stack” the middle/ring fingers—both are fine.\n\n3. Keep space and softness\n   Leave space between palm and handle. Grip softly so the wrist is very mobile.\n\n4. Forehand feel\n   Most control comes from the thumb–index pinch. Keep the blade slightly closed for drives; open a touch for topspin.\n\n5. Backhand options\n   For traditional penhold, use the forehand side for many shots by rotating the wrist. For RPB (reverse penhold backhand), contact with the back side—keep those rear fingers relaxed to allow the flip.\n\n6. Quick checks\n   No squeezing; blade moves easily with wrist; contact points feel precise at the thumb/index.\n\n# Common mistakes to avoid\n\n* **Death grip** (too tight) → kills wrist speed and touch.\n* **Index finger too high** across the rubber → limits forehand.\n* **Thumb creeping up** onto the rubber → blocks backhand.\n* **Palming the blade** (covering rubber with the palm) → reduces spin and reach.\n\n# Fast reminders\n\n* Relax first, then add just enough firmness at contact.\n* Small pressure shifts (thumb ↔ index) fine-tune forehand/backhand angles.\n* Start with shakehand if you’re unsure; it’s the most versatile for beginners.\n\nIf you want, I can also generate a second image focused solely on **shakehand** or **penhold**, or make printable cue cards.\n",

If anything hurts (sharp pain), stop and adjust range or seek a pro.\n\n## 1) Set Your Stance\n\n* Feet about shoulder-width apart (a little wider or narrower based on comfort).\n* Toes turned slightly out (≈5–20°) so knees can track over them.\n* Distribute weight through the whole foot (heel + big toe + little toe). Look ahead.\n\n## 2) Brace\n\n* Take a deep breath “360°” into your belly and sides.\n* Gently lock ribs down as if prepping for a cough; keep spine neutral.\n* Set shoulders down/back. Lightly squeeze glutes.\n\n## 3) Initiate: Hips Back, Knees Out\n\n* Start the squat by sending the hips slightly back, then let the knees bend.\n* Let knees track in line with the toes (don’t cave inward).\n* Reach your arms forward a bit for balance if helpful.\n\n## 4) Descend Under Control\n\n* Lower smoothly; keep chest proud and back neutral.\n* Keep heels flat; stay balanced over mid-foot.\n* Go as low as **your** mobility allows—aim for thighs parallel to the floor or lower without losing your brace.\n\n## 5) Check the Bottom Position\n\n* Knees track over toes; don’t collapse inward.\n* Weight balanced (not on toes only; heels stay down).\n* Avoid excessive pelvis tuck (“butt wink”). If it appears, stop just above that range.\n\n## 6) Drive Up\n\n* Push the floor away through mid-foot/heels.\n* Stand up by extending hips and knees together (no shooting hips up first).\n* Keep knees tracking over toes; exhale through the sticking point.\n\n## 7) Finish Tall\n\n* Stand tall with hips and knees fully extended.\n* Reset your breath/bracing before the next rep.\n\n---\n\n## Breathing Cue (Simple)\n\n* **Inhale & brace** before you descend → **exhale** as you drive up.\n* For heavier sets, you can hold a gentle brace until you pass the hardest point, then exhale.\n\n## Common Mistakes → Quick Fixes\n\n* **Heels lift:** Widen stance slightly; slow down; work ankle mobility; try a small heel lift (5–10 mm).\n* **Knees cave in:** Think “spread the floor” or “push knees toward pinky toes.”\n* **Back rounds:** Re-brace; keep chest proud; shorten depth slightly; include core work.\n* **Leaning too far forward:** Bring heels under hips; use counterbalance arms; keep gaze forward.\n* **Bouncing/relaxing at bottom:** Pause briefly; keep tension.\n\n## Regressions (Easier)\n\n* **Box/Chair Squat:** Tap a box/chair behind you for depth control.\n* **Supported Squat:** Hold a doorframe/TRX for assistance.\n* **Heel-elevated Squat:** Place thin plates under heels to ease ankle demand.\n\n## Helpful Progressions (Harder)\n\n* **Goblet Squat (light weight)** for counterbalance and torso position.\n* **Tempo Squat:** 3-sec lower, no bounce, smooth up.\n* **Pause Squat:** 1–2 sec hold at the bottom with tension.\n* **Split Squat / Pistol to Box** for single-leg control.\n\n## Suggested Sets & Reps\n\n* Beginners: **3 × 8–10 reps**, rest 60–90 s.\n* Warm-up: 5 min light cardio + 2–3 easy ramp-up sets.\n\n> Goal: Smooth, controlled reps with consistent depth and balance.

As a general rule of thumb, players under the age of 12 will use a glove in the 10–11 inch (25.4–27.9 cm) range. Older players will use something between 11 and 13 inch glove. Before playing regularly with your glove, it’s important to beak in your glove. One of the best ways to break in your glove is by practicing your catch. [1] X Expert Source Isaac Hess Baseball Coach & Instructor Expert Interview 2. Position your body. Catching a baseball relies heavily on your stance and body position. You should be in the athletic position to prepare catching a ball. The athletic position takes the following into effect: Bend your knees slightly. This will give you the flexibility to lung for the ball and keep your mind focused. Keep your shoulders positioned towards the target. This will make it easier to visualize and react once the ball comes towards you. Stand on the balls of your feet instead of standing flat-footed. 3. Watch the ball. The key to catching a baseball is to never let the ball out of your sight. Keep your eyes fixed from the time the ball leaves the thrower's hand until it lands in your glove. By watching the ball, you can track the ball’s flight plan, and prepare for the right stance to catch the ball. ”You can’t catch what you can’t see,” meaning it'll be difficult to catch the ball if your eye is off the ball. 4. Go to the ball. Don’t feel inclined to stay anchored in one place, but instead move to catch the ball. If the ball is thrown and you can tell it will land behind you, run backwards while watching the ball. In baseball, catchers play by zone defense. When the ball enters your zone, it’s your job to move to it. 5. Position your glove. Hold your glove with your palm facing outwards in front of your body. Position the glove in the direction of the target who is throwing the ball. If the ball is thrown above your belly button, you can use this stance to catch the ball with little adjustment. If the throw is below your belly button, rotate your glove so that your fingers are pointed down. When the ball is thrown above your body, use the first position mentioned, but extend your arm upwards. 6. Catch the baseball. Catch the ball in the pocket of the glove. The pocket is another name for the palm of the glove. Close your hand immediately once the ball makes contact with your glove. Get into the practice of using your second hand to secure the catch. Using your second hand will also prepare you to throw once you become a catcher. Your free hand needs to have quick access to the ball. 7. Keep your vision clear. Be careful not to obstruct your vision with your glove when going for the catch. If a ball is heading towards your face, move your glove to the position at the last second. This might take some practice, but the goal is to watch the ball till the final second. Practice throwing with a friend to avoid a black eye on game day. You can usually reposition yourself to avoid your face crossing the ball’s flight path.",

Ready stance\n   • Feet a little wider than shoulders, knees bent.\n   • Glove open in front of your chest; throwing hand just above/behind the glove. Eyes on the ball.\n\n2. Read & move\n   • Track the ball early. Take short, quick steps to get **behind** it so it comes to you—not you to it.\n\n3. Present the glove\n   • **Fly balls/pop-ups:** glove **fingers up**, pocket to the ball at about eye level or slightly above your head.\n   • **Grounders:** get low; glove **fingers down** with the heel near the ground, body square to the ball.\n\n4. Soften the catch (“give”)\n   • Let the glove travel a bit with the ball’s momentum. Don’t stab.\n\n5. Use two hands\n   • As the ball hits the pocket, cover it with your throwing hand immediately.\n\n6. Funnel to your chest\n   • Bring the glove to the center of your body to secure it and prepare a throw or tag.\n\n7. Communicate & position\n   • For fly balls say “Mine!” and take priority if you have the easier angle. Avoid backpedaling—turn and run to the spot, then get set.\n\n8. Bare-hand (only on soft tosses/foul balls in the stands)\n   • Keep fingers together, elbows slightly bent, and **give** with the ball. Avoid trying to bare-hand hard line drives.\n\n9. Common cues\n   • “Fingers up for sky; fingers down for ground.”\n   • “Move your feet, not just your glove.”\n   • “Two hands; funnel to chest.”\n\n10. Quick practice drill\n    • Toss yourself short pop-ups and grounders, focusing on glove angle and soft hands; progress to partner throws from different angles.\n\n---\n\nI also created a **visual step-by-step image** (separate from the text) showing ready stance, moving under a fly ball (fingers up), and fielding a grounder (fingers down) with two-hand secure and funnel to chest.\n",

    "generated_text": "Here’s the image and the explanation kept separate, just like you asked.\n\n# 1) Diagram (labeled parts)\n\n*(See the image above.)*\nThe figure shows a compound light microscope with the light path and numbered callouts for each component.\n\n---\n\n# 2) How a compound microscope works (with parts explained)\n\n## Big picture\n\nA compound microscope uses **two lens systems**—the **objective** near the specimen and the **eyepiece (ocular)** near your eye—to create **high total magnification**. Light from the **illuminator** is focused through the specimen by the **condenser**. The **objective** forms a **real, inverted intermediate image** inside the tube; the **eyepiece** then magnifies that into the **virtual image** you see.\n\n**Total magnification = (eyepiece power) × (objective power).**\n**Resolution** (smallest detail you can separate) improves with higher **NA** of the objective/condenser and with shorter wavelengths of light.\n\n## What each numbered part does (match to the image)\n\n1. **Eyepiece (ocular)** – Magnifies the intermediate image made by the objective; often 10×. Some models include a **diopter** ring to match focus between your eyes.\n\n2. **Head / Body tube** – Holds the optics at fixed spacing so the objective image forms at the correct plane for the eyepiece.\n\n3. **Revolving nosepiece (turret)** – Clicks different **objective lenses** into the light path quickly.\n\n4. **Objectives (4×, 10×, 40×, 100× oil)** – The primary magnifiers; also the main drivers of **resolution** and **working distance**.\n\n   * **4× (scanning):** wide field, easy to find the specimen.\n   * **10× (low):** more detail, still forgiving.\n   * **40× (high dry):** fine detail; use **fine focus only**.\n   * **100× oil:** highest detail; requires immersion oil to boost NA and resolution.\n\n5. **Stage** – Platform that holds the slide. Often a **mechanical stage** with **X–Y controls** for precise movement.\n\n6. **Slide & stage clips** – Secure the specimen directly over the light path.\n\n7. **Coarse focus knob** – Moves the stage quickly to find focus at low power.\n\n8. **Fine focus knob** – Small, precise motion for sharp focus, especially at 40×/100×.\n\n9. **Condenser** – A lens system that concentrates light onto the specimen; usually raised close to the underside of the slide for brightfield.\n\n10. **Iris diaphragm (substage)** – Adjustable aperture beneath the condenser. **Open** for brightness and resolution; **close** for more contrast (but less resolution). Use together with the condenser height.\n\n11. **Field diaphragm (if present)** – Controls the illuminated field size; helps set Köhler illumination and reduce stray light.\n\n12. **Illuminator / LED** – The light source. Often paired with a **brightness control** on the base.\n\n13. **On/Off & brightness control** – Powers the lamp and sets intensity to a comfortable, non-glary level.\n\n14. **Arm** – Structural support; the safe handle when carrying the scope (other hand under the base).\n\n15. **Base & power connector** – House the lamp and electronics; provides stability.\n\n### What’s happening to the image?\n\n* **Illuminator → condenser → specimen:** Light is focused into a cone that passes through the specimen. Transparent/colored areas transmit or absorb light differently, creating contrast.\n* **Specimen → objective:** The objective produces a **real, inverted** magnified image inside the tube.\n* **Objective image → eyepiece:** The eyepiece acts like a magnifier, creating a **virtual image** your eye focuses on.\n* **Result:** High magnification with limited depth of field; tiny focus adjustments and proper illumination are crucial.\n\nIf you want, I can make a printable one-page “How it works + parts” handout using this same diagram.\n",

Often shows layers and may contain fossils.\n* **Metamorphic** – forms when any rock is **changed by heat and pressure** (without melting). Minerals **recrystallize** and may align into bands (e.g., slate, gneiss).\n\n## Main pathways (follow the arrows)\n\n1. **Magma → Igneous**: cooling & crystallization.\n2. **Igneous → Sediments**: uplift exposes rock; weathering breaks it down; erosion moves it.\n3. **Sediments → Sedimentary rock**: burial + compaction + cementation (lithification).\n4. **Sedimentary → Metamorphic**: deeper burial adds heat & pressure; minerals reorganize.\n5. **Metamorphic → Magma**: if heating goes far enough, the rock **melts**.\n6. **Shortcuts**:\n\n   * Any rock type can **weather & erode** back to **sediments**.\n   * **Igneous → Metamorphic** directly (heat & pressure).\n   * **Sedimentary → Magma** if it melts (usually via subduction).\n   * **Metamorphic → Sedimentary** if uplifted, weathered, and re-lithified.\n\n## What drives the cycle?\n\n* **Plate tectonics**: subduction drags rocks deep (heat, pressure, melting); collisions uplift mountains (exposure & weathering).\n* **Water, ice, wind**: power weathering & erosion at the surface.\n* **Heat from Earth’s interior**: fuels metamorphism and melting.\n\n## Quick ID tips\n\n* **Igneous**: interlocking crystals; sometimes glassy or with gas holes.\n* **Sedimentary**: visible grains or fossils; layered or crumbly cement.\n* **Metamorphic**: stretched/banded minerals; harder, denser versions of earlier rocks.\n\n## Big idea\n\nThe rock cycle isn’t a single loop—it’s a **network of paths**. Rocks can take many routes and spend millions of years in one stage before changing again.\n\nIf you want, I can label the diagram with a specific example path (e.g., “basalt → sand → sandstone → quartzite → magma”) or add classroom-ready annotations.\n",

    "reference_text": "An example input volume is shown in red (e.g. a 32x32x3 CIFAR-10 image), and an example volume of neurons in the first Convolutional layer is shown in blue. Each neuron in this layer is connected only to a local spatial region in the input volume, but spans the full depth (i.e. all color channels). There are multiple neurons (5 in this example) along the depth, each using a different filter. These neurons share the same receptive field but not weights. On the right, a neuron is depicted using the standard neural network model: it computes a weighted sum of inputs followed by a non-linearity (activation function), with connectivity restricted spatially in CNNs.",

    "generated_text": "Alright, here’s how a CNN layer processes an image:\n\n1. **Input Image**: A CNN starts with an image, which is represented as a matrix of pixel values. Each pixel has color channels (e.g., RGB).\n\n2. **Convolution Operation**: In a CNN layer, a small matrix called a filter (or kernel) slides over the image. This filter performs a dot product between itself and the section of the image it’s currently covering. It moves across the entire image, extracting features like edges, textures, or patterns.\n\n3. **Neurons**: Each neuron in the CNN layer corresponds to one region of the image processed by the filter. After the filter slides over an area of the image, the result of the convolution is passed to a neuron, which computes the weighted sum of the values and then applies an activation function (like ReLU).\n\n4. **Activation**: After the neuron processes the result, it passes the output to the next layer or saves it for further processing.\n\nNow I’ll generate an image to visualize this process. Please give me a moment.\n",
