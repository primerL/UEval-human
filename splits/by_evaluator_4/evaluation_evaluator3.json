    "reference_text": "1. 1. Begin the dog cartoon outline by drawing his face. Outline the eyes using curved lines. Extend the side of one eye to form the top of the long snout or muzzle. 2. 2. At the end of the snout, draw a circle. This is the dog’s nose. Use curved lines to trace the side of the dog’s face and his forehead. Above the eyes, use curved lines to enclose the pointed eyebrows 3. 3. Draw the dog’s open, smiling mouth. Below the nose, draw a wide, curved “W” shaped line. Let it meet the nose on one side. On the other, extend the arm of the “W” all the way to the corner of the mouth. Below this, use curved lines to outline the lower jaw, the inside of the mouth, and the tongue. Contour the corner of the mouth with short lines. At the front of the snout, draw two small, triangular teeth. 4. 4. Use curved lines to enclose the rounded shapes of the dog’s ears. Then, use long curved lines to trace the top of the head, neck, and side of the body. 5. 5. Extend a long curved line below the lower jaw to form the chest. Then, use a pair of long curved lines to draw the leg. At the bottom, use overlapping curved lines to create the toes and enclose the paw. 6. 6. Contour the chest with a curved line and draw the remaining front leg. Again, use curved lines. Those at the toes should overlap. 7. 7. Draw the rear leg, bent into a sitting position, using curved lines. Again the toes should utilize overlapping curved lines. 8. 8. Draw the remaining leg of the sitting dog. Use curved lines for the back, the bent leg, and the round paw. Band the paw with short lines. 9. 9. Complete your dog cartoon outline by drawing his wagging tail. Extend two curved lines from the dog’s hip and allow them to meet at a sharp point. Beside the tail, sketch a hatch mark pattern using curved lines to simulate the motion of the tail. 10. Color your cartoon dog. We’ve shaded ours dark brown like a chocolate labrador dog.",

Keep your lines light until the end—then trace the final outline darker.\n\nYou’ll need: pencil, eraser, black pen/marker, and optional colored pencils/markers.\n\nStep-by-step (8 steps)\n\nHead & muzzle\nDraw a big circle for the head. Lightly add a short vertical guideline. At the bottom of the circle, sketch a small horizontal oval for the muzzle (it overlaps the circle).\n\nEars\nAdd two floppy, teardrop-like ears on the sides of the head. Their tips should hang lower than the midpoint of the head.\n\nNose & smile\nOn the muzzle, draw a small rounded triangle for the nose. From its sides, curve two short lines downward to suggest a smile. Add a wide “U” under the smile for the mouth/tongue.\n\nEyes & brows\nAbove the muzzle, draw two big ovals for eyes. Add tiny white circles for highlights and fill the pupils around them. Two small curved dashes above each eye make friendly brows.\n\nBody shape\nUnder the head, draw a wide “U” shape for the chest/body. Let the head overlap the body slightly (no neck needed).\n\nFront legs & paws\nFrom the body, add two long “U” shapes straight down for the front legs. At the bottom, draw 3 small bumps on each paw to suggest toes.\n\nBack leg & tail\nOn one side, add a “C” shaped curve for the back leg with a small oval paw peeking out. Sketch a short curved tail to one side.\n\nDetails, cleanup & style\nAdd a collar band and tiny tag under the head if you like. Erase extra construction lines. Trace your final outline with thicker, smooth lines. Optional spots/patches and a soft ground shadow under the paws.\n\nQuick coloring guide (optional)\n\nCoat: light brown or cream\n\nEars/patches: slightly darker brown\n\nNose: black; Tongue: pink\n\nCollar: any bright color (e.g., blue)\n\nLeave small white shines in the eyes\n\nProportion tip: Big head + small body + big eyes = instant cute.\nVariation: Try perky ears, a curlier tail, or different spot patterns.",

    "reference_text": "1. 1. Begin by drawing a circle to outline the shape of the watermelon. 2. 2. Use curved lines to outline a \"T\" shape extending from the top of the watermelon. Erase guide lines as necessary. This forms the watermelon's stem. 3. 3. Draw two sets of wavy lines extending downward from the stem. Allow one to reach the opposite side of the watermelon. For the other pair, allow the lines to meet in a sharp point. These form the first of the watermelon's characteristic stripes. 4. 4. Draw two more stripes. Extend one set of lines down from the stem, the other up from the bottom of the melon. Allow each to end in a sharp point. 5. 5. Draw more stripes across the watermelon, filling the empty spaces. 6. 6. Next, you will draw a slice of cut watermelon. Draw a wide \"U\" shaped line, allowing it to overlap the completed watermelon. Then, connect the ends of the \"U\" using a straight line. 7. 7. Give the slice a three dimensional shape by drawing a curved line from one corner of the shape to the bottom of the shape. 8. 8. Erase the guide lines from behind the watermelon slice. 9. 9. Detail the inside of the slice. Draw a curved line parallel to the original \"U\" shaped line. This separates the green and flavorless rind from the sweet, pink fruit. Then, draw seeds. Use a teardrop shape for each seed. Notice how the seeds are positioned in a circular pattern, with the pointed end of the teardrop toward the center. 10. 10. Color your watermelon. The outside of the watermelon is typically striped in shades of green. The center of the melon is often pink, red, orange, or yellow.",

This is the overall slice.\n\n**Step 2 — Rind band**\nInside the arc, add a second, smaller arc that follows the first one. Leave a thin gap between them—this gap is the light-green rind.\n\n**Step 3 — Clean the edges**\nRound the two corners where the arc meets the bottom edge so the slice looks soft and juicy.\n\n**Step 4 — First seeds**\nPlace 5–7 small teardrop shapes across the pulp. Point the narrow ends toward the center.\n\n**Step 5 — Seed variety**\nAdd a few tiny dots or smaller seeds between the larger ones to make it feel natural.\n\n**Step 6 — Base colors**\nColor the pulp a bright red/pink. Fill the rind band a light green and the very outer edge a darker green. Color the seeds black.\n\n**Step 7 — Shading**\nDeepen the red slightly near the rind for a subtle gradient. Add a light, soft shadow under the slice so it sits on the page.\n\n**Step 8 — Highlights & finish**\nAdd tiny white glints on a few seeds and along the top curve. Thicken the outer outline a touch for a bold, finished look.\n\n**Optional tweaks**\n\n* Add a small “bite” notch on the top curve and adjust the seeds around it.\n* Sprinkle a couple of pale freckles on the pulp for texture.\n* Turn it into a wedge on a plate by sketching a thin oval and resting the slice on it.\n\nWant a version with fewer or more steps (e.g., a 4-step kid-friendly version)? I can spin that up too.\n",

    "reference_text": "1. Keep everything cold. If you are using butter in your cookies (and even, to a certain degree, if you aren't) you will want to keep your ingredients refrigerator-cold. This will make your cookies much more firm and keep them from spreading out in the oven. This means that you'll have to warm up the butter enough to work with it by placing it on the counter, rather than in the microwave. Absolutely never melt it in order to mix it into the dough. A great practice is to cool your dough in the fridge for an hour before rolling it out. 2. Always cream butter and sugar. If your recipe calls for butter and doesn't specifically prohibit this practice, you should always \"cream\" the butter and the sugar first. This is a process by which you mix the two until a sort of paste is formed. 3. Try to use salted butter. Sweet cream butter tends to make cookies taste too sweet. The salt will balance out the sweetness of the cookie just enough to make it taste much better over all. You won't be able to properly taste the salt, but believe us, you'll notice the difference. 4. Change the recipe to alter the final product. If you find a recipe that you love the taste of but want a different texture, it is totally possible to alter the recipe just a bit in order to get exactly what you want! Experiment, or try these tricks: Use cake flour instead of regular flour, shortening instead of butter (or for part of the butter), or about 2 teaspoons of cornstarch along with 4 teaspoons less flour in order to get fluffy, cakey, and softer cookies. Use 2 tablespoons of milk, an extra tablespoon or two of butter, or switch your white sugar for brown to get a crispy cookie. Use melted butter to mix dough and then chill it before baking (undercook a minute or two) to get a chewy cookie. You can also use only yolks, instead of whites. Using a rubber spatula often helps speed up the mixing process if you are not using a machine. 5. Weigh your ingredients. If you find that you still struggle with getting your recipe to turn out right, bake like the pros (and Europeans!) do and weigh your ingredients. Get a good electronic kitchen scale and do your recipe based on weight. This will help ensure the perfect cookie. 6. Use an ice cream scoop to make cookies even. If you want to make sure that every cookie in a batch turns out looking the same, use an ice cream scoop to get perfectly equal balls of dough. 7. Use parchment paper. Skip the Silpat in favor of parchment paper. Silpat can make it difficult for cookies to cook evenly and it also keeps the bottoms from developing that perfect crispness. Parchment paper turns out a much better cookie. 8. Bake on the bottom of your cookie sheet. If you notice that the cookies at the edge of your sheet are prone to getting over cooked, use an Round or oval pan. If you don't have one, improvise and flip the pan over to use the bottom! 9. Know your oven. Every oven is different and it is important for you to know how yours behaves. If you know what to expect, then you can find ways to work around the expected problems. For example, if you notice that cookies on one corner or side bake faster than in another, make sure you turn the pan part-way through the baking process. 10. Start with a cold pan. Put your baking sheet in the fridge to cool before you put each set of cookies on. If you want to save time, you can scoop the dough onto parchment paper and store them in the fridge until they are ready to go out on a cooled pan. This means cooling the pan between each set of 12 too! 11. Don't overbake your cookies. If anything it's better to under-bake them. For the first batch carefully watch them and time for when they get the first hint of brown at the edges. Edge browning usually means you've gone too far, though these cookies are still perfectly good (especially if you like yours crispy!). Once you know how long it takes to reach that point, pull them out maybe 30 seconds before they brown for perfectly soft cookies. If you are using white chocolate chips in your cookies, be careful, as they can burn particularly easily. 12. Let cookies sit on the pan. Let your cookies sit on the pan for a few minutes before taking them off. This will let them firm up on the bottom, making them much easier to remove.",

    "question": "How to change a flat tire safely on the roadside? Provide a visual guide and text the steps. ",
    "reference_text": "1. Find a safe area where traffic won’t be a risk. If you are near a road, park as far from traffic as possible and turn on your emergency hazard lights. Don’t park on an incline to keep your vehicle from rolling away, and stay off of soft soil or grass. If you have to drive slowly for a block or two to get to a safe, flat area, then so be it.Examples of safe areas are as follows: The shoulder of the highway, a public parking lot, or a large space with no pedestrian activity. Apply the parking brake once you’re parked to ensure the vehicle doesn’t move. For added peace of mind, place heavy rocks or blocks around each tire you aren’t changing to keep the vehicle from rolling. 2. The spare will likely be underneath a cover in the trunk. Every make and model will be a little bit different, but your spare should be under the cloth or plastic cover at the bottom of your trunk. Retrieve the wheel from the trunk. Also, remove the jack and the tire iron you need to remove the lug nuts. The tools for completing the change - including the jack, and lug wrench - will be located near the spare tire. On most vehicles, the tire iron is part of the jack. You’ll use it to turn the bolt on the end of the jack to raise or lower it, and also to remove the lug nuts on the tire. If you drive a Jeep or a large SUV, the spare tire may be on the outside or underneath the vehicle. If you don’t have a spare, your vehicle may have a sealant kit to temporarily patch your flat tire . If you don’t have that either, call a tow truck. 3. Move around your vehicle and check for any damaged components or wheels. This article focuses on replacing damaged tires - be sure to contact roadside services in the event you are experiencing any issues you cannot safely handle yourself either due to lack of experience, tools, replacement parts, or severity of the damage. 4. Provided you have the tools necessary, find a solid point on the frame of your vehicle to elevate the portion of the car near the wheel you need to replace. Remember to place the jack in a position that won't be hit by yourself or others, risking the vehicle being dropped from the jack. Elevate the vehicle until the tire is no longer touching the ground (recommended 1-2 inches) Place the jack on a part of the frame that will not damage or warp components of your vehicle, causing more damage. Begin to lift the vehicle by pressing down on the floor jack or by turning the floor jack handle slowly. You will begin to see the tires lift from the ground. To have enough room to dismount the tire, you want to make sure that the tire is at least lifted 3-6 inches from off the ground. Grab your jack stands. These are used as a safety precaution so that the vehicle doesn't fall to the ground in case your floor jacks break or slip. The owner's manual will show you where to place them. To engage the jack stands, use the lever that is attached to them and line it up with the jack stand point (Usually indicated by an arrow engraved into the car) but only raise the stand to about an inch or two away from the jack stand point which is usually the frame of the car. CAREFULLY release the pressure from your floor jack so that the vehicle falls into place with the jack stands 5. Remove the hubcap and loosen the nuts part-way. Start with the lowest bolt and avoid causing damage to the undamaged bolts/lug nuts. Pry the hubcap off using the flat end of your tire iron or a flathead screwdriver. Do not remove the lug nuts entirely. Just use the end of the tire iron to loosen the nuts by turning them counterclockwise so that there’s no longer any resistance. You should be able to spin the nuts by hand, but they shouldn’t be so loose that they spin freely. By keeping the wheel on the ground when you first loosen the nuts, you'll make sure that you're turning the nuts instead of the wheel. Your tire iron may have different sizes of openings on each end. The correct end for the nut will slip easily onto it, but it won’t be so loose that it rattles. If your vehicle doesn’t have a hub cap, don’t worry about that part. If it does, your hub cap may have a center cap that needs to be unscrewed first. On some newer vehicles you need a special “key” to unlock one of the lug nuts as a theft prevention strategy. Look in your glove box and trunk for a special tool that’ll remove that unique lug nut. These lug nuts will have a unique groove inside of them. Use the key to remove the locking lug nut. Keep all bolts as you will be using them to connect your spare tire to your car. 6. Place the divot in the jack directly under the metal rim of the frame. Get on the ground and use the flashlight on your phone to take a closer look. Touch the area directly behind the metal body of your exterior to feel and look for a thin, metal length. This is your frame. Set the jack underneath the frame right next to the tire you’re replacing. Many cars have molded plastic along the bottom. If you don't place the jack in the right spot, it will crack the plastic when you start lifting. If you're not sure about the right place to put the jack, read your owner's manual. There may be a small notch or mark just behind the front wheel wells, or in front of the rear wheel wells where the jack is intended to be placed. 7. Use the jack to raise your tire 4–6 inches (10–15 cm) off of the ground. Turn the handle of the jack clockwise to begin raising the platform up. Once the platform on the jack makes contact with the vehicle, take a look at the point where the jack meets the frame to confirm it’s on your frame. If it isn’t, loosen the jack and reposition it. If it is, continue to lift your vehicle off the ground . The vast majority of jacks are scissor jacks. You use the tire iron or a rod to twist the nut on the side and hoist the vehicle. You might have a pump-assisted jack, though. With a pump jack, you repeatedly move the handle up and down to raise the vehicle hydraulically. This can be kind of freaky the first time you do it. You might think your jack is going to snap or your car is going to tilt over. Don’t worry! Your jack and vehicle are designed to handle this. It can take a few minutes and a lot of elbow grease to get that vehicle up, so feel free to take breaks if you need to. It’s worth double-checking to make sure the jack is on the frame. You really don’t want to damage your vehicle with the jack. Make sure the vehicle is secure in the air by pressing down on the side of the vehicle that is jacked up in the air. Next, you need to add some wheel chalks to the opposite side wheels of the vehicle. If you have the car jacked from the front left side of the vehicle, then you would want to place two wheel-chocks under the rear tires to prevent the vehicle from rolling. 8. Pop the nuts off by hand and pull the tire off. You already loosened the nuts, so removing them should be fairly easy. Use the tire iron and brace the tire with your non-dominant hand if you need to. With all of the lug nuts removed, slide your busted wheel off of the axle and set it aside. Flip your hubcap upside down to turn it into a small bowl and set your lug nuts inside so that you don’t lose them. Use the proper body mechanics when dismounting a tire. Mounting and dismounting a tire is very tiresome and heavy on your back so you always want to make sure you squat using your legs with your back straight. Never place your legs under the vehicle while it's lifted up because that's a safety hazard. If you can, grab a small mechanics chair as this will help secure your back. 9. The side of the spare with the valve stem on it faces out. Line the lug nut bolts up with the openings on the spare and slide the spare on to the axle - holding the tires at the positions of 4 and 8, lifting the tire slightly and pulling the tire out. The valve stem is the little rubber pipe that sticks out where you add air to the tire. If it’s pointed inward towards the body of the vehicle, the tire is backwards. Fun fact, the spare tire is also known as a “donut.” Take one of the bolts you removed from the old tire, take your spare tire, and align the sockets on the tire rim with the sockets on the tire mount, then place the tire on the mount. Insert the bolt into the topmost socket and rotate the bolt into its socket enough to ensure the tire will not fall off the mount, but not too tightly as to fully insert the bolt into the socket. Grab the tire using proper body mechanics (this is important for your physical health) by getting down on one knee and rolling the tire onto your foot. Carefully lift with your arms and foot to align the tire with the hub. Align the tire with the wheel hub. Press the tire and wheel against the hub so that it sits completely flushed and symmetrical with the hub bearing (this is important for tightening reasons). Keep your foot pressed onto the tire to secure it. Begin screwing the lug nuts back on. First, you want to make sure that you're hub cap is securely placed back on. Start with one lug nut and thread it all the way down on the wheel stud to help hold the tire on the hub. 10. Don’t tighten the nuts using the tire iron just yet. Gently slide each over the bolt and tighten it by hand to partially lock them in place. You will tighten the lug nuts again once the car is down and there is no risk of it falling. Just to clarify, use the same lug nuts that were previously on your wheel. You don’t need special lug nuts for the spare. 11. With the wheel on the axle, lower the jack and remove it. Turn the handle or bolt on the jack counterclockwise to begin lowering the vehicle. Continue lowering the vehicle until the tire is comfortably back on the ground. Then, carefully remove the jack from underneath and set it back in your trunk. [8] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Keep your entire body out from underneath the vehicle. If the jack slips your vehicle gets closer to the ground, you don’t want your body underneath it. 12. Completely tighten the nuts until they won’t turn any further. Using the tire iron, tighten each nuts 3-4 times and then move on to the lug nut on the opposite side. Work in a star pattern to ensure the nuts are secured in an even pattern. Continue tightening the nuts in a cycle until all of the lug nuts are completely secure. [9] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source After you’ve tightened each nut, try to tighten each nut one more time to ensure they’re as tight as they can possibly get. Put your busted tire in the trunk alongside the jack and tire iron. 13. Remove and release all of the jacks from the car. Start off by lifting the vehicle up from the jack stands by using the floor jacks. Do this to make sure you are able to remove the jack stands. Remove the jack stands from under the vehicle. Remove the old tire and wheel assembly. Release the pressure from the floor jack by slowly turning the lever to the left and you will start to see the vehicle slowly fall to the ground. Once the vehicle is fully on the ground. Remove the floor jack. Remove wheel chocks. 14. Keep your speed under 50 miles per hour (80 km/h) and don't go further than 50 miles (80 km). If your spare is a full-size tire (rather than a donut), you can drive the same way you normally would. Check your tire pressure and fill your spare with air as needed. This is especially important if the spare has been in your trunk for a while, since it may have leaked a little in storage. [10] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Head to an auto shop as soon as you can. Small punctures can usually be repaired for $15-100. If the tire is not repairable, you may need to buy a replacement tire.",

If you can’t get fully out of traffic or it’s a blind curve, bridge, or narrow shoulder, **call roadside assistance** instead.\n* Turn on **hazard lights**. Put on a **reflective vest** if you have one.\n* Set the **parking brake** (and put the car in Park; manual: 1st gear or Reverse).\n* Place **wheel chocks**/big stones **on both sides** of a tire opposite the flat (e.g., if front-left is flat, chock the right-rear).\n* Get people and pets away from the traffic side. Never crawl under the vehicle.\n\n## Tools you’ll need\n\n* Spare tire (compact “donut” or full-size)\n* Jack and **owner’s-manual jack point locations**\n* Lug wrench (and locking-lug key if you have one)\n* Wheel chocks, gloves, flashlight, and warning triangle/cones (if available)\n\n## Step-by-step\n\n1. **Prep the area**\n   Place a warning triangle 100–200 ft (30–60 m) behind the car if safe to do so.\n\n2. **Expose the lugs**\n   Remove the hubcap/wheel cover if present.\n\n3. **Break the lug nuts loose**\n   With the wheel **still on the ground**, use the lug wrench to loosen each nut about ½–1 turn. Push down with your foot if needed; don’t fully remove them yet.\n\n4. **Position the jack at the correct jack point**\n   Check your manual for the reinforced spot near the flat tire. Never jack on plastic trim or thin metal.\n\n5. **Lift the vehicle**\n   Raise until the flat tire just clears the ground by an inch or two (2–5 cm). Keep your body and limbs out from under the car.\n\n6. **Remove the flat wheel**\n   Spin off the loosened lug nuts and set them in a safe spot (a hubcap works). Pull the wheel straight off the hub.\n\n7. **Mount the spare**\n   Line up the holes with the studs; slide the wheel fully onto the hub. Thread the lug nuts **by hand** until snug.\n\n8. **Initial tighten in a star pattern**\n   Using the wrench, snug the nuts in a **star/ criss-cross** sequence—do not fully torque yet.\n\n9. **Lower the vehicle and final tighten**\n   Lower the car until the tire just contacts the ground and the jack is free. Now fully tighten the nuts in the **same star pattern** until firmly secure. (Later, torque to your vehicle’s spec.)\n\n10. **Stow and check**\n    Put the flat and tools away, remove chocks/triangle, and check the spare’s pressure. For compact spares, **observe the sidewall limits** (often around 50 mph / 80 km/h and short distances). Drive to a tire shop for repair or replacement **as soon as possible**.\n\n## Extra tips\n\n* If a nut won’t budge, apply steady pressure rather than jerky motions; a short pipe over the wrench handle can help (carefully).\n* If the jack sinks on soft ground, place a solid board under it.\n* After 5–10 miles (8–16 km), **re-check lug nut tightness**.\n* If you have **TPMS**, the warning light may stay on until the repaired tire is back on.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can also turn these steps into a printable one-page checklist or add car-specific jack points based on your make/model.\n",

    "reference_text": "1. Use a mnemonic to remember how to tie the knot. Think of the loop as a \"rabbit's hole\" and the string end coming off the loop as a \"tree\". Imagine the other loose end of the string, which you're holding in your right hand, is the \"rabbit\". The rabbit comes up the hole, runs around the tree, and goes back down the hole. Another way to remember how to make this knot is with a rhyme: \"Lay the bight to make a hole Then under the back and around the pole Over the top and through the eye Clinch it tight and let it lie\" 2. Hold one end of the rope in your left hand. This will be your ‘standing end’ or the end that does not move (consider this end the ‘hole’ and the ‘tree’.) Hold the other end in your right hand (this is the free end--the end of the rope that will be used to form the knot, or the ‘rabbit.’)Make a small loop with the end of the string in your left hand. This loop is the ‘hole’ the rabbit comes out of. [4] X Expert Source Jordan Frazier Knot Tying Expert Expert Interview These instructions assume you start with an \"underhand\" loop, so that the free end of the string is under the intersection formed by the loop. 3. Draw the end of the string in your right hand (the rabbit) through the loop made by your left hand (the hole. ) The end should be coming towards you as it goes through the loop. Think of this as the rabbit coming out of its hole. [7] X Expert Source Jordan Frazier Knot Tying Expert Expert Interview 4. Bring the ‘rabbit’ end around (behind) the string. This string is the part pointing upwards from the loop (the ‘tree’.) Pull the ‘rabbit’ back through the loop and down into the ‘hole’. This time the end is going away from you. [9] X Expert Source Jordan Frazier Knot Tying Expert Expert Interview 5. Take the top loose string in your left hand.

Keep the loop large enough to pass the working end through.\n\n2. **Rabbit out of the hole.** Pass the working end **up through the loop**.\n\n3. **Around the tree.** Take the working end **around the back of the standing part**, then back toward the loop.\n\n4. **Back into the hole.** Feed the working end **down through the original loop**.\n\n5. **Dress and set.** Hold the loop you’ve made and pull firmly on the **standing part** while snugging the “collar” around it. Adjust until the knot is compact and tidy.\n\n6. **Safety checks (do these every time):**\n\n* There’s a **fixed loop** that does not slip when you pull the standing part.\n* A single **collar** (turn) wraps cleanly around the standing part.\n* Leave a **tail ≥ 10–15 cm (4–6 in)**.\n\n7. **Make it more secure (recommended):**\n\n* Tie a **double overhand stopper** with the tail snug against the bowline, **or**\n* Use a **Yosemite finish** (run the tail up behind the loop and back down beside the standing part, then dress snug). Either helps prevent loosening from repeated loading/unloading.\n\n**When to use (and not):**\n\n* Great for forming a non-slipping loop for general utility, boating, and rescue rigging by trained users.\n* **Avoid for life-safety or climbing unless you’re trained** and use an appropriate backup/variation; bowlines can loosen under cyclic load or if shaken when slack.\n\n**Quick memory aid:** *“Rabbit comes out of the hole, goes around the tree, and back into the hole.”*\n\n**To untie:** Push the collar to break the set, then pull the working end—bowlines are easy to release even after heavy load.\n",

    "question": "How to connect a Wi-Fi network on a laptop? Provide a visual guide and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Get a wireless router. Most ISPs will supply you with both a Wi-Fi router and modem, or a Wi-Fi router/modem combo. If your ISP only provides a modem, or you don't want to rent a Wi-Fi router from them, you can buy your own. Various factors will determine which router is best for you, including speed, bandwidth capabilities, and Wi-Fi coverage/distance. Speed These days, all wireless routers (even the budget models) are pretty fast. If you need ultra-fast Wi-Fi speeds—perhaps multiple devices will be streaming movies in 4k or 8k, gaming, or sharing large amounts of data at the same time—opt for a router with Wi-Fi 7 technology . If you're on a budget and want blazingly fast but don't need extreme , opt for a Wi-Fi 6 router . Distance If you have a very large home, consider a mesh router system instead of a standalone Wi-Fi router. Mesh Wi-Fi systems consist of a router with a series of nodes to expand the coverage in all areas of your home. 2.4GHz or 5Ghz 2.4 GHz covers a wider distance, is supported by more devices, and is good at penetrating walls and large furniture. However, it's more prone to interference because more devices (including cordless phones) use this frequency. 5 GHz is faster and less prone to interference, but it does have a smaller coverage area and cannot penetrate solid objects as well as 2.4GHz. Security The highest level of security is WPA3, but some devices (including Nintendo Switch) don't support it. Choose a router that has a WPA2/WPA3 Transitional mode, which allows newer devices to use WPA3 and older devices to use WPA2. 2. Connect the modem to the appropriate port on your wall. If you have a separate modem, connect it to the DSL, cable, or fiber port on your wall using the cable provided to you by your ISP, and turn the unit on. If the modem and router are one unit, connect that to the wall port, and turn the unit on. 3. Connect the router to your modem and turn it on. If the router is separate from the modem, you'll need to connect it to the modem using an ethernet cable. Plug one end of the cable into the port on the back of the router labeled WAN/WLAN/Internet or similar, and the other end into the modem's LAN port. 4. Place your router. For the best possible signal , position the wireless router in a central location, away from walls and metal objects, and not on the floor. [3] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source Any obstacles will degrade the signal. Remember that it must be physically connected to your modem, so this may limit your options when placing the router. 5. Connect your computer or phone to the router. Some routers have a mobile app you can install that makes Wi-Fi setup a breeze—check your router's documentation to see if you can download an app and use it to set up your router. If not, you'll need to connect your computer to the router using an ethernet cable to set up your wireless network. 6. Log in to the router's admin page. If you connected your computer via ethernet, you'll need to open the router's configuration page and sign in with the admin password. Open a web browser and enter the router's web address. According to Showers, the IP address is typically https://192.168.1.1, https://192.168.0.1, or https://10.0.0.1, but can vary based on the router model. [4] X Expert Source Tyrone Showers Technologist Expert Interview Consult the documentation that came with the router to find the exact address. The router will ask you for a login name and password, or sometimes just a password. The password you'll need to use is in your router's documentation or sometimes printed on a sticker on the back of the router. If you bought a used router, you can find the default admin password for most routers at https://portforward.com/router-password . 7. Enter your internet connection information. In most cases, your router should obtain this information automatically from your modem. If it doesn't, you may need to enter some information about your internet connection—often a username and password and DNS server addresses. If you're not sure what to enter, contact your ISP. 8. Set up your Wi-Fi access point. Locate the Wireless or Wi-Fi section of your router's configuration page. You can enable Wi-Fi, change the network name, and set the security level here. The \"SSID\" field is where you'll enter a name for your Wi-Fi router. This is the name people will see when they want to connect to the internet. If you live in an area with a lot of public traffic, avoid putting any identifiable information in the SSID, as anyone with a wireless device can see it. Make sure to set the security/encryption to the latest version allowed by your router. This will most likely be WPA3 (best) or WPA2 (less good, but more compatible with older devices). Create a password for your Wi-Fi network. While this is not required, Showers recommends it. \"Creating a strong password, combining letters, numbers, and special characters is important to enhance security,\" he says. [5] X Expert Source Tyrone Showers Technologist Expert Interview 9. Apply your settings. Make sure you click the Apply or Save Changes button in your router's configuration when you are done changing the settings. The router will process for a moment (or reboot), and your new settings will take effect. 10. Connect your devices to Wi-Fi. Once the router is online, you can connect your Wi-Fi capable devices so they can access the internet. Android Swipe down from the top of the screen. Tap and hold the Wi-Fi icon to open your Wi-Fi settings. Slide the \"Wi-Fi\" switch to \"ON\" (or tap the option to Use Wi-Fi ). Select your Wi-Fi network name. iPhone or iPad Open Settings . Tap Wi-Fi . Tap the switch ON . Select your Wi-Fi network's name. Windows 10/11 Click the network icon in the taskbar, which usually looks like a Wi-Fi fan or similar to the bars you normally see at the top of your cell phone. It may be a globe if you're not currently connected. Click your Wi-Fi network's name. Click Connect . Mac Click the Wi-Fi icon (the fan) in the menu bar. Select your Wi-Fi network. 11. Enter the password. Type the password you created when configuring your Wi-Fi router, and click Connect or similar. Once the password is accepted, your device will be connected to the Wi-Fi access point. 12. Test your internet connection. Once you are connected to the network, wait a moment for your IP address to be assigned. Open a web browser and try to connect to a website you don't normally visit to ensure you aren't loading the website from memory.",

    "reference_text": "1. Lie on your back on top of an exercise mat . Find a comfortable spot to lie down on the floor where you can spread out. Keep your neck and back in line. Tighten your abs and push your lower back flat against the mat the entire time you’re performing crunches to ensure your core stays engaged. If you don’t have an exercise mat, then lay out a soft towel or do crunches on a carpeted floor so you’re more comfortable. 2. Bend your knees so your feet are flat on the floor. Position your feet so your heels are about 12 to 18 in (30 to 46 cm) from your tailbone. Bend your knees to 90 degrees and keep them about hip-width apart. Make sure the soles of your feet are flat against the ground. 3. Cross your arms in front of your chest with your hands just below your shoulders. Keep your elbows pointed down toward your feet. Lay your hands flat on your chest right in front of your shoulders. Avoid putting your hands behind your head since you could accidentally strain your neck when you perform your exercise. For more resistance during your workout, hold a 5 to 10 pounds (2.3 to 4.5 kg) plate weight over your chest. 4. Lift your shoulder blades off of the mat with a smooth, controlled motion. Tighten your abs and take a deep breath in. As you exhale, engage your muscles to raise your torso off of the mat all while keeping your lower back and feet flat on the floor. Lift yourself just enough to get your shoulder blades off of the floor. Support yourself in this position for 1–2 seconds. Avoid sitting all the way up when you perform a crunch since muscles in your back and hips will take over, and you could strain yourself. Keep your lower back, tailbone, and feet in contact with the mat at all times. If your feet lift off of the ground while you’re performing a rep, have someone hold onto your feet or position them underneath something heavy. Keep your neck relaxed instead of tucking in your chin. Try to keep an apple-sized space between your chin and your chest. Looking at the ceiling can help keep you from curling your neck too much. 5. Lower yourself back down with a slow, steady motion. Gently inhale as you slowly lower your torso down to the floor. Use a smooth, controlled motion to work your ab muscles and prevent you from injuring yourself. Take a brief pause to finish 1 rep. If you rush into the next rep, you’ll end up using the momentum of your body moving instead of your muscles to lift yourself up. Additionally, you’re more likely to injure your back Try doing a set of 10–12 crunches to start working out your abs . As you start building up your core strength, try doing 2–3 sets or increasing the number of reps you do.",

Brace\n\n* Take a breath in.\n* Gently **brace your core** as if preparing for a light poke, keeping hips stacked and elbow open.\n\n3. Crunch up\n\n* **Exhale** and bring your **left ribcage toward your left hip**.\n* Lift both shoulders a few inches; keep elbow wide and gaze forward.\n* Knees and legs stay quiet—movement comes from your **obliques**, not from tugging the head.\n\n4. Pause\n\n* Hold the top position for **1 second**, keep breathing softly, feel the side squeeze.\n\n5. Lower with control\n\n* **Inhale** and lower your shoulders back to the start without collapsing. Maintain tension.\n\n6. Repeat & switch sides\n\n* Do **8–15 controlled reps**, then **flip to your left side** to work the right obliques.\n* Aim for **2–3 sets per side**.\n\n### Form tips & common mistakes\n\n* Keep hips stacked; don’t roll backward.\n* Don’t yank on your head—your hand just supports.\n* Small range is fine; prioritize **slow, controlled** reps.\n* If you feel your neck more than your side, reduce range and press your tongue lightly to the roof of your mouth to help stabilize.\n\n### Make it easier\n\n* Place top hand across your chest instead of behind your head.\n* Keep bottom arm straight and use it lightly on the floor for balance.\n\n### Make it harder\n\n* Straighten your legs and keep feet slightly off the floor.\n* Add a light dumbbell or small plate held against the side of your ribcage (still no neck pulling).\n\nIf you want variations (e.g., **side plank crunch** or **standing side crunch**), say the word and I’ll add those too.\n",

    "reference_text": "This diagram shows Ray (optics). In optics, a ray is an idealized model of light, obtained by choosing a line that is perpendicular to the wave fronts of the actual light, and that points in the direction of energy flow. Rays are used to model the propagation of light through an optical system by dividing the real light field up into discrete rays that can be computationally propagated through the system by the techniques of ray tracing. All three rays should meet at the same point. The Principal Ray or Chief Ray in an optical system is the meridional ray that starts at the edge of the object and passes through the center of the aperture stop. This ray crosses the optical axis at the locations of the pupils. The Central Ray is perpendicular to infrared radiation. The Focal Ray is drawn from the tip of the object through (or towards) the focal point, reflecting off the mirror parallel to the principal axis.",

When you inhale, air enters the respiratory system through your nose and ends up in your lungs, where gas exchange with the blood takes place. In the nose, mucus and hairs trap any dust or other particles in the air. The air is also warmed and moistened so it wont harm delicate tissues of the lungs. Next, air passes through the pharynx, a passageway that is shared with the digestive system. From the pharynx, the air passes next through the larynx, or voice box. After the larynx, air moves into the trachea, or wind pipe. This is a long tube that leads down to the lungs in the chest. In the chest, the trachea divides as it enters the lungs to form the right and left bronchi (bronchus, singular). These passages are covered with mucus and tiny hairs called cilia. The mucus traps any remaining particles in the air. The cilia move and sweep the particles and mucus toward the throat so they can be expelled from the body. Air passes from the bronchi into smaller passages called bronchioles. The bronchioles end in clusters of tiny air sacs called alveoli (alveolus, singular). The alveoli in the lungs are where gas exchange between the air and blood takes place. Shown also is the rib (or ribs) the protect the lungs and other vital organs within the chest.",

    "generated_text": "# Text Explanation (separate from the image)\n\n## Big picture\n\nYour respiratory system is a branching network that conducts air to millions of tiny sacs (alveoli) where gas exchange happens. It’s often divided into:\n\n* **Upper respiratory tract:** nose/nostrils, nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, and pharynx (throat).\n* **Lower respiratory tract:** larynx (voice box), trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and lungs (ending in alveoli).\n* **Supporting structures:** chest wall, **diaphragm**, intercostal muscles, and the **pleura** (the double-layer lining around the lungs).\n\n## The parts, in order\n\n1. **Nostrils (nares) & nasal vestibule** – entry points. Nose hairs and mucus trap dust; blood-rich lining warms and humidifies air.\n   *(If you breathe through your mouth, the first steps below are bypassed.)*\n2. **Nasal cavity & turbinates** – twisty shelves that swirl air to filter, warm, and moisten it; smell receptors live high up.\n3. **Paranasal sinuses** (frontal, maxillary, ethmoid, sphenoid) – air-filled spaces that lighten the skull and condition air; drain into the nasal cavity.\n4. **Pharynx (throat)** – three regions:\n\n   * **Nasopharynx** (behind the nose)\n   * **Oropharynx** (behind the mouth; food + air share this space)\n   * **Laryngopharynx** (leads to the larynx for air or esophagus for food)\n5. **Epiglottis** – a leaf-shaped flap that tilts down when you swallow so food doesn’t enter the airway.\n6. **Larynx (voice box)** – contains vocal cords; the opening between them is the **glottis**.\n7. **Trachea (windpipe)** – rigid tube with C-shaped cartilage rings; lined with cilia that sweep debris upward (the “mucociliary escalator”).\n8. **Carina** – the tracheal split.\n9. **Main bronchi** – right and left primary branches; the **right main bronchus** is shorter, wider, and more vertical (aspired objects lodge here more often).\n10. **Lobar (secondary) bronchi** – one to each lung lobe (3 right, 2 left).\n11. **Segmental (tertiary) bronchi** – supply bronchopulmonary segments.\n12. **Conducting bronchioles → terminal bronchioles** – small airways without cartilage; still just conducting air (no gas exchange yet).\n13. **Respiratory bronchioles → alveolar ducts → alveolar sacs → alveoli** – the **respiratory zone** where oxygen enters blood and carbon dioxide leaves across the ultra-thin alveolar–capillary membrane. Type II cells make **surfactant** to keep alveoli open.\n\n**Around the lungs:**\n\n* **Pleura:** visceral layer on the lung, parietal layer on the chest wall; a thin fluid layer lets lungs glide during breathing.\n* **Diaphragm & intercostals:** main breathing muscles.\n\n## How air travels (step-by-step)\n\n1. **Inhale:** Diaphragm contracts and moves down, ribs lift—chest cavity expands, drawing air in.\n2. **Air path:** Nostrils → nasal cavity (or mouth) → pharynx → past epiglottis → **larynx** → **trachea** → **carina** → **right/left main bronchi** → lobar bronchi → segmental bronchi → bronchioles → terminal bronchioles → **respiratory bronchioles** → **alveolar ducts** → **alveolar sacs** → **alveoli**.\n3. **Gas exchange:** Oxygen diffuses from alveoli to blood; carbon dioxide diffuses from blood to alveoli.\n4. **Exhale:** Diaphragm relaxes and moves up; lungs recoil and air flows out along the same path in reverse.\n\n## Quick memory trick\n\n**“N-N-P-L-T-B-B-b-b-A”** → Nose, Nasal cavity, Pharynx, Larynx, Trachea, Bronchi (main → lobar → segmental), bronchioles (conducting → terminal), **A**lveoli (via respiratory bronchioles & ducts).\n\n---\n\nIf you’d like, I can add labels or callouts tailored to your study needs (e.g., “conducting vs. respiratory zone,” or a zoom-in on the vocal cords).\n",

    "reference_text": "In a GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), two key gates control information flow: the reset gate \\( R_t \\) and the update gate \\( Z_t \\). Both gates are computed from the current input \\( X_t \\) and the previous hidden state \\( H_{t-1} \\) using fully connected layers followed by a sigmoid activation. The reset gate determines how much past information to forget, while the update gate decides how much of the new hidden state will be kept versus carried over from the past. This figure illustrates how both gates are computed in parallel by concatenating \\( X_t \\) and \\( H_{t-1} \\), passing them through separate linear layers and activation functions.
