    "question": "How to draw a cartoon dog? Use visual steps suitable for beginners and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. 1. Begin the dog cartoon outline by drawing his face. Outline the eyes using curved lines. Extend the side of one eye to form the top of the long snout or muzzle. 2. 2. At the end of the snout, draw a circle. This is the dog’s nose. Use curved lines to trace the side of the dog’s face and his forehead. Above the eyes, use curved lines to enclose the pointed eyebrows 3. 3. Draw the dog’s open, smiling mouth. Below the nose, draw a wide, curved “W” shaped line. Let it meet the nose on one side. On the other, extend the arm of the “W” all the way to the corner of the mouth. Below this, use curved lines to outline the lower jaw, the inside of the mouth, and the tongue. Contour the corner of the mouth with short lines. At the front of the snout, draw two small, triangular teeth. 4. 4. Use curved lines to enclose the rounded shapes of the dog’s ears. Then, use long curved lines to trace the top of the head, neck, and side of the body. 5. 5. Extend a long curved line below the lower jaw to form the chest. Then, use a pair of long curved lines to draw the leg. At the bottom, use overlapping curved lines to create the toes and enclose the paw. 6. 6. Contour the chest with a curved line and draw the remaining front leg. Again, use curved lines. Those at the toes should overlap. 7. 7. Draw the rear leg, bent into a sitting position, using curved lines. Again the toes should utilize overlapping curved lines. 8. 8. Draw the remaining leg of the sitting dog. Use curved lines for the back, the bent leg, and the round paw. Band the paw with short lines. 9. 9. Complete your dog cartoon outline by drawing his wagging tail. Extend two curved lines from the dog’s hip and allow them to meet at a sharp point. Beside the tail, sketch a hatch mark pattern using curved lines to simulate the motion of the tail. 10. Color your cartoon dog. We’ve shaded ours dark brown like a chocolate labrador dog.",

Keep your lines light until the end—then trace the final outline darker.\n\nYou’ll need: pencil, eraser, black pen/marker, and optional colored pencils/markers.\n\nStep-by-step (8 steps)\n\nHead & muzzle\nDraw a big circle for the head. Lightly add a short vertical guideline. At the bottom of the circle, sketch a small horizontal oval for the muzzle (it overlaps the circle).\n\nEars\nAdd two floppy, teardrop-like ears on the sides of the head. Their tips should hang lower than the midpoint of the head.\n\nNose & smile\nOn the muzzle, draw a small rounded triangle for the nose. From its sides, curve two short lines downward to suggest a smile. Add a wide “U” under the smile for the mouth/tongue.\n\nEyes & brows\nAbove the muzzle, draw two big ovals for eyes. Add tiny white circles for highlights and fill the pupils around them. Two small curved dashes above each eye make friendly brows.\n\nBody shape\nUnder the head, draw a wide “U” shape for the chest/body. Let the head overlap the body slightly (no neck needed).\n\nFront legs & paws\nFrom the body, add two long “U” shapes straight down for the front legs. At the bottom, draw 3 small bumps on each paw to suggest toes.\n\nBack leg & tail\nOn one side, add a “C” shaped curve for the back leg with a small oval paw peeking out. Sketch a short curved tail to one side.\n\nDetails, cleanup & style\nAdd a collar band and tiny tag under the head if you like. Erase extra construction lines. Trace your final outline with thicker, smooth lines. Optional spots/patches and a soft ground shadow under the paws.\n\nQuick coloring guide (optional)\n\nCoat: light brown or cream\n\nEars/patches: slightly darker brown\n\nNose: black; Tongue: pink\n\nCollar: any bright color (e.g., blue)\n\nLeave small white shines in the eyes\n\nProportion tip: Big head + small body + big eyes = instant cute.\nVariation: Try perky ears, a curlier tail, or different spot patterns.",

    "reference_text": "1. 1. Begin by drawing a circle to outline the shape of the watermelon. 2. 2. Use curved lines to outline a \"T\" shape extending from the top of the watermelon. Erase guide lines as necessary. This forms the watermelon's stem. 3. 3. Draw two sets of wavy lines extending downward from the stem. Allow one to reach the opposite side of the watermelon. For the other pair, allow the lines to meet in a sharp point. These form the first of the watermelon's characteristic stripes. 4. 4. Draw two more stripes. Extend one set of lines down from the stem, the other up from the bottom of the melon. Allow each to end in a sharp point. 5. 5. Draw more stripes across the watermelon, filling the empty spaces. 6. 6. Next, you will draw a slice of cut watermelon. Draw a wide \"U\" shaped line, allowing it to overlap the completed watermelon. Then, connect the ends of the \"U\" using a straight line. 7. 7. Give the slice a three dimensional shape by drawing a curved line from one corner of the shape to the bottom of the shape. 8. 8. Erase the guide lines from behind the watermelon slice. 9. 9. Detail the inside of the slice. Draw a curved line parallel to the original \"U\" shaped line. This separates the green and flavorless rind from the sweet, pink fruit. Then, draw seeds. Use a teardrop shape for each seed. Notice how the seeds are positioned in a circular pattern, with the pointed end of the teardrop toward the center. 10. 10. Color your watermelon. The outside of the watermelon is typically striped in shades of green. The center of the melon is often pink, red, orange, or yellow.",

This is the overall slice.\n\n**Step 2 — Rind band**\nInside the arc, add a second, smaller arc that follows the first one. Leave a thin gap between them—this gap is the light-green rind.\n\n**Step 3 — Clean the edges**\nRound the two corners where the arc meets the bottom edge so the slice looks soft and juicy.\n\n**Step 4 — First seeds**\nPlace 5–7 small teardrop shapes across the pulp. Point the narrow ends toward the center.\n\n**Step 5 — Seed variety**\nAdd a few tiny dots or smaller seeds between the larger ones to make it feel natural.\n\n**Step 6 — Base colors**\nColor the pulp a bright red/pink. Fill the rind band a light green and the very outer edge a darker green. Color the seeds black.\n\n**Step 7 — Shading**\nDeepen the red slightly near the rind for a subtle gradient. Add a light, soft shadow under the slice so it sits on the page.\n\n**Step 8 — Highlights & finish**\nAdd tiny white glints on a few seeds and along the top curve. Thicken the outer outline a touch for a bold, finished look.\n\n**Optional tweaks**\n\n* Add a small “bite” notch on the top curve and adjust the seeds around it.\n* Sprinkle a couple of pale freckles on the pulp for texture.\n* Turn it into a wedge on a plate by sketching a thin oval and resting the slice on it.\n\nWant a version with fewer or more steps (e.g., a 4-step kid-friendly version)? I can spin that up too.\n",

    "question": "How to bake cookies from scratch? Provide a visual guide and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Keep everything cold. If you are using butter in your cookies (and even, to a certain degree, if you aren't) you will want to keep your ingredients refrigerator-cold. This will make your cookies much more firm and keep them from spreading out in the oven. This means that you'll have to warm up the butter enough to work with it by placing it on the counter, rather than in the microwave. Absolutely never melt it in order to mix it into the dough. A great practice is to cool your dough in the fridge for an hour before rolling it out. 2. Always cream butter and sugar. If your recipe calls for butter and doesn't specifically prohibit this practice, you should always \"cream\" the butter and the sugar first. This is a process by which you mix the two until a sort of paste is formed. 3. Try to use salted butter. Sweet cream butter tends to make cookies taste too sweet. The salt will balance out the sweetness of the cookie just enough to make it taste much better over all. You won't be able to properly taste the salt, but believe us, you'll notice the difference. 4. Change the recipe to alter the final product. If you find a recipe that you love the taste of but want a different texture, it is totally possible to alter the recipe just a bit in order to get exactly what you want! Experiment, or try these tricks: Use cake flour instead of regular flour, shortening instead of butter (or for part of the butter), or about 2 teaspoons of cornstarch along with 4 teaspoons less flour in order to get fluffy, cakey, and softer cookies. Use 2 tablespoons of milk, an extra tablespoon or two of butter, or switch your white sugar for brown to get a crispy cookie. Use melted butter to mix dough and then chill it before baking (undercook a minute or two) to get a chewy cookie. You can also use only yolks, instead of whites. Using a rubber spatula often helps speed up the mixing process if you are not using a machine. 5. Weigh your ingredients. If you find that you still struggle with getting your recipe to turn out right, bake like the pros (and Europeans!) do and weigh your ingredients. Get a good electronic kitchen scale and do your recipe based on weight. This will help ensure the perfect cookie. 6. Use an ice cream scoop to make cookies even. If you want to make sure that every cookie in a batch turns out looking the same, use an ice cream scoop to get perfectly equal balls of dough. 7. Use parchment paper. Skip the Silpat in favor of parchment paper. Silpat can make it difficult for cookies to cook evenly and it also keeps the bottoms from developing that perfect crispness. Parchment paper turns out a much better cookie. 8. Bake on the bottom of your cookie sheet. If you notice that the cookies at the edge of your sheet are prone to getting over cooked, use an Round or oval pan. If you don't have one, improvise and flip the pan over to use the bottom! 9. Know your oven. Every oven is different and it is important for you to know how yours behaves. If you know what to expect, then you can find ways to work around the expected problems. For example, if you notice that cookies on one corner or side bake faster than in another, make sure you turn the pan part-way through the baking process. 10. Start with a cold pan. Put your baking sheet in the fridge to cool before you put each set of cookies on. If you want to save time, you can scoop the dough onto parchment paper and store them in the fridge until they are ready to go out on a cooled pan. This means cooling the pan between each set of 12 too! 11. Don't overbake your cookies. If anything it's better to under-bake them. For the first batch carefully watch them and time for when they get the first hint of brown at the edges. Edge browning usually means you've gone too far, though these cookies are still perfectly good (especially if you like yours crispy!). Once you know how long it takes to reach that point, pull them out maybe 30 seconds before they brown for perfectly soft cookies. If you are using white chocolate chips in your cookies, be careful, as they can burn particularly easily. 12. Let cookies sit on the pan. Let your cookies sit on the pan for a few minutes before taking them off. This will let them firm up on the bottom, making them much easier to remove.",

    "question": "How to change a flat tire safely on the roadside? Provide a visual guide and text the steps. ",
    "reference_text": "1. Find a safe area where traffic won’t be a risk. If you are near a road, park as far from traffic as possible and turn on your emergency hazard lights. Don’t park on an incline to keep your vehicle from rolling away, and stay off of soft soil or grass. If you have to drive slowly for a block or two to get to a safe, flat area, then so be it.Examples of safe areas are as follows: The shoulder of the highway, a public parking lot, or a large space with no pedestrian activity. Apply the parking brake once you’re parked to ensure the vehicle doesn’t move. For added peace of mind, place heavy rocks or blocks around each tire you aren’t changing to keep the vehicle from rolling. 2. The spare will likely be underneath a cover in the trunk. Every make and model will be a little bit different, but your spare should be under the cloth or plastic cover at the bottom of your trunk. Retrieve the wheel from the trunk. Also, remove the jack and the tire iron you need to remove the lug nuts. The tools for completing the change - including the jack, and lug wrench - will be located near the spare tire. On most vehicles, the tire iron is part of the jack. You’ll use it to turn the bolt on the end of the jack to raise or lower it, and also to remove the lug nuts on the tire. If you drive a Jeep or a large SUV, the spare tire may be on the outside or underneath the vehicle. If you don’t have a spare, your vehicle may have a sealant kit to temporarily patch your flat tire . If you don’t have that either, call a tow truck. 3. Move around your vehicle and check for any damaged components or wheels. This article focuses on replacing damaged tires - be sure to contact roadside services in the event you are experiencing any issues you cannot safely handle yourself either due to lack of experience, tools, replacement parts, or severity of the damage. 4. Provided you have the tools necessary, find a solid point on the frame of your vehicle to elevate the portion of the car near the wheel you need to replace. Remember to place the jack in a position that won't be hit by yourself or others, risking the vehicle being dropped from the jack. Elevate the vehicle until the tire is no longer touching the ground (recommended 1-2 inches) Place the jack on a part of the frame that will not damage or warp components of your vehicle, causing more damage. Begin to lift the vehicle by pressing down on the floor jack or by turning the floor jack handle slowly. You will begin to see the tires lift from the ground. To have enough room to dismount the tire, you want to make sure that the tire is at least lifted 3-6 inches from off the ground. Grab your jack stands. These are used as a safety precaution so that the vehicle doesn't fall to the ground in case your floor jacks break or slip. The owner's manual will show you where to place them. To engage the jack stands, use the lever that is attached to them and line it up with the jack stand point (Usually indicated by an arrow engraved into the car) but only raise the stand to about an inch or two away from the jack stand point which is usually the frame of the car. CAREFULLY release the pressure from your floor jack so that the vehicle falls into place with the jack stands 5. Remove the hubcap and loosen the nuts part-way. Start with the lowest bolt and avoid causing damage to the undamaged bolts/lug nuts. Pry the hubcap off using the flat end of your tire iron or a flathead screwdriver. Do not remove the lug nuts entirely. Just use the end of the tire iron to loosen the nuts by turning them counterclockwise so that there’s no longer any resistance. You should be able to spin the nuts by hand, but they shouldn’t be so loose that they spin freely. By keeping the wheel on the ground when you first loosen the nuts, you'll make sure that you're turning the nuts instead of the wheel. Your tire iron may have different sizes of openings on each end. The correct end for the nut will slip easily onto it, but it won’t be so loose that it rattles. If your vehicle doesn’t have a hub cap, don’t worry about that part. If it does, your hub cap may have a center cap that needs to be unscrewed first. On some newer vehicles you need a special “key” to unlock one of the lug nuts as a theft prevention strategy. Look in your glove box and trunk for a special tool that’ll remove that unique lug nut. These lug nuts will have a unique groove inside of them. Use the key to remove the locking lug nut. Keep all bolts as you will be using them to connect your spare tire to your car. 6. Place the divot in the jack directly under the metal rim of the frame. Get on the ground and use the flashlight on your phone to take a closer look. Touch the area directly behind the metal body of your exterior to feel and look for a thin, metal length. This is your frame. Set the jack underneath the frame right next to the tire you’re replacing. Many cars have molded plastic along the bottom. If you don't place the jack in the right spot, it will crack the plastic when you start lifting. If you're not sure about the right place to put the jack, read your owner's manual. There may be a small notch or mark just behind the front wheel wells, or in front of the rear wheel wells where the jack is intended to be placed. 7. Use the jack to raise your tire 4–6 inches (10–15 cm) off of the ground. Turn the handle of the jack clockwise to begin raising the platform up. Once the platform on the jack makes contact with the vehicle, take a look at the point where the jack meets the frame to confirm it’s on your frame. If it isn’t, loosen the jack and reposition it. If it is, continue to lift your vehicle off the ground . The vast majority of jacks are scissor jacks. You use the tire iron or a rod to twist the nut on the side and hoist the vehicle. You might have a pump-assisted jack, though. With a pump jack, you repeatedly move the handle up and down to raise the vehicle hydraulically. This can be kind of freaky the first time you do it. You might think your jack is going to snap or your car is going to tilt over. Don’t worry! Your jack and vehicle are designed to handle this. It can take a few minutes and a lot of elbow grease to get that vehicle up, so feel free to take breaks if you need to. It’s worth double-checking to make sure the jack is on the frame. You really don’t want to damage your vehicle with the jack. Make sure the vehicle is secure in the air by pressing down on the side of the vehicle that is jacked up in the air. Next, you need to add some wheel chalks to the opposite side wheels of the vehicle. If you have the car jacked from the front left side of the vehicle, then you would want to place two wheel-chocks under the rear tires to prevent the vehicle from rolling. 8. Pop the nuts off by hand and pull the tire off. You already loosened the nuts, so removing them should be fairly easy. Use the tire iron and brace the tire with your non-dominant hand if you need to. With all of the lug nuts removed, slide your busted wheel off of the axle and set it aside. Flip your hubcap upside down to turn it into a small bowl and set your lug nuts inside so that you don’t lose them. Use the proper body mechanics when dismounting a tire. Mounting and dismounting a tire is very tiresome and heavy on your back so you always want to make sure you squat using your legs with your back straight. Never place your legs under the vehicle while it's lifted up because that's a safety hazard. If you can, grab a small mechanics chair as this will help secure your back. 9. The side of the spare with the valve stem on it faces out. Line the lug nut bolts up with the openings on the spare and slide the spare on to the axle - holding the tires at the positions of 4 and 8, lifting the tire slightly and pulling the tire out. The valve stem is the little rubber pipe that sticks out where you add air to the tire. If it’s pointed inward towards the body of the vehicle, the tire is backwards. Fun fact, the spare tire is also known as a “donut.” Take one of the bolts you removed from the old tire, take your spare tire, and align the sockets on the tire rim with the sockets on the tire mount, then place the tire on the mount. Insert the bolt into the topmost socket and rotate the bolt into its socket enough to ensure the tire will not fall off the mount, but not too tightly as to fully insert the bolt into the socket. Grab the tire using proper body mechanics (this is important for your physical health) by getting down on one knee and rolling the tire onto your foot. Carefully lift with your arms and foot to align the tire with the hub. Align the tire with the wheel hub. Press the tire and wheel against the hub so that it sits completely flushed and symmetrical with the hub bearing (this is important for tightening reasons). Keep your foot pressed onto the tire to secure it. Begin screwing the lug nuts back on. First, you want to make sure that you're hub cap is securely placed back on. Start with one lug nut and thread it all the way down on the wheel stud to help hold the tire on the hub. 10. Don’t tighten the nuts using the tire iron just yet. Gently slide each over the bolt and tighten it by hand to partially lock them in place. You will tighten the lug nuts again once the car is down and there is no risk of it falling. Just to clarify, use the same lug nuts that were previously on your wheel. You don’t need special lug nuts for the spare. 11. With the wheel on the axle, lower the jack and remove it. Turn the handle or bolt on the jack counterclockwise to begin lowering the vehicle. Continue lowering the vehicle until the tire is comfortably back on the ground. Then, carefully remove the jack from underneath and set it back in your trunk. [8] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Keep your entire body out from underneath the vehicle. If the jack slips your vehicle gets closer to the ground, you don’t want your body underneath it. 12. Completely tighten the nuts until they won’t turn any further. Using the tire iron, tighten each nuts 3-4 times and then move on to the lug nut on the opposite side. Work in a star pattern to ensure the nuts are secured in an even pattern. Continue tightening the nuts in a cycle until all of the lug nuts are completely secure. [9] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source After you’ve tightened each nut, try to tighten each nut one more time to ensure they’re as tight as they can possibly get. Put your busted tire in the trunk alongside the jack and tire iron. 13. Remove and release all of the jacks from the car. Start off by lifting the vehicle up from the jack stands by using the floor jacks. Do this to make sure you are able to remove the jack stands. Remove the jack stands from under the vehicle. Remove the old tire and wheel assembly. Release the pressure from the floor jack by slowly turning the lever to the left and you will start to see the vehicle slowly fall to the ground. Once the vehicle is fully on the ground. Remove the floor jack. Remove wheel chocks. 14. Keep your speed under 50 miles per hour (80 km/h) and don't go further than 50 miles (80 km). If your spare is a full-size tire (rather than a donut), you can drive the same way you normally would. Check your tire pressure and fill your spare with air as needed. This is especially important if the spare has been in your trunk for a while, since it may have leaked a little in storage. [10] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Head to an auto shop as soon as you can. Small punctures can usually be repaired for $15-100. If the tire is not repairable, you may need to buy a replacement tire.",

If you can’t get fully out of traffic or it’s a blind curve, bridge, or narrow shoulder, **call roadside assistance** instead.\n* Turn on **hazard lights**. Put on a **reflective vest** if you have one.\n* Set the **parking brake** (and put the car in Park; manual: 1st gear or Reverse).\n* Place **wheel chocks**/big stones **on both sides** of a tire opposite the flat (e.g., if front-left is flat, chock the right-rear).\n* Get people and pets away from the traffic side. Never crawl under the vehicle.\n\n## Tools you’ll need\n\n* Spare tire (compact “donut” or full-size)\n* Jack and **owner’s-manual jack point locations**\n* Lug wrench (and locking-lug key if you have one)\n* Wheel chocks, gloves, flashlight, and warning triangle/cones (if available)\n\n## Step-by-step\n\n1. **Prep the area**\n   Place a warning triangle 100–200 ft (30–60 m) behind the car if safe to do so.\n\n2. **Expose the lugs**\n   Remove the hubcap/wheel cover if present.\n\n3. **Break the lug nuts loose**\n   With the wheel **still on the ground**, use the lug wrench to loosen each nut about ½–1 turn. Push down with your foot if needed; don’t fully remove them yet.\n\n4. **Position the jack at the correct jack point**\n   Check your manual for the reinforced spot near the flat tire. Never jack on plastic trim or thin metal.\n\n5. **Lift the vehicle**\n   Raise until the flat tire just clears the ground by an inch or two (2–5 cm). Keep your body and limbs out from under the car.\n\n6. **Remove the flat wheel**\n   Spin off the loosened lug nuts and set them in a safe spot (a hubcap works). Pull the wheel straight off the hub.\n\n7. **Mount the spare**\n   Line up the holes with the studs; slide the wheel fully onto the hub. Thread the lug nuts **by hand** until snug.\n\n8. **Initial tighten in a star pattern**\n   Using the wrench, snug the nuts in a **star/ criss-cross** sequence—do not fully torque yet.\n\n9. **Lower the vehicle and final tighten**\n   Lower the car until the tire just contacts the ground and the jack is free. Now fully tighten the nuts in the **same star pattern** until firmly secure. (Later, torque to your vehicle’s spec.)\n\n10. **Stow and check**\n    Put the flat and tools away, remove chocks/triangle, and check the spare’s pressure. For compact spares, **observe the sidewall limits** (often around 50 mph / 80 km/h and short distances). Drive to a tire shop for repair or replacement **as soon as possible**.\n\n## Extra tips\n\n* If a nut won’t budge, apply steady pressure rather than jerky motions; a short pipe over the wrench handle can help (carefully).\n* If the jack sinks on soft ground, place a solid board under it.\n* After 5–10 miles (8–16 km), **re-check lug nut tightness**.\n* If you have **TPMS**, the warning light may stay on until the repaired tire is back on.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can also turn these steps into a printable one-page checklist or add car-specific jack points based on your make/model.\n",

    "reference_text": "1. Use a mnemonic to remember how to tie the knot. Think of the loop as a \"rabbit's hole\" and the string end coming off the loop as a \"tree\". Imagine the other loose end of the string, which you're holding in your right hand, is the \"rabbit\". The rabbit comes up the hole, runs around the tree, and goes back down the hole. Another way to remember how to make this knot is with a rhyme: \"Lay the bight to make a hole Then under the back and around the pole Over the top and through the eye Clinch it tight and let it lie\" 2. Hold one end of the rope in your left hand. This will be your ‘standing end’ or the end that does not move (consider this end the ‘hole’ and the ‘tree’.) Hold the other end in your right hand (this is the free end--the end of the rope that will be used to form the knot, or the ‘rabbit.’)Make a small loop with the end of the string in your left hand. This loop is the ‘hole’ the rabbit comes out of. [4] X Expert Source Jordan Frazier Knot Tying Expert Expert Interview These instructions assume you start with an \"underhand\" loop, so that the free end of the string is under the intersection formed by the loop. 3. Draw the end of the string in your right hand (the rabbit) through the loop made by your left hand (the hole. ) The end should be coming towards you as it goes through the loop. Think of this as the rabbit coming out of its hole. [7] X Expert Source Jordan Frazier Knot Tying Expert Expert Interview 4. Bring the ‘rabbit’ end around (behind) the string. This string is the part pointing upwards from the loop (the ‘tree’.) Pull the ‘rabbit’ back through the loop and down into the ‘hole’. This time the end is going away from you.

Either helps prevent loosening from repeated loading/unloading.\n\n**When to use (and not):**\n\n* Great for forming a non-slipping loop for general utility, boating, and rescue rigging by trained users.\n* **Avoid for life-safety or climbing unless you’re trained** and use an appropriate backup/variation; bowlines can loosen under cyclic load or if shaken when slack.\n\n**Quick memory aid:** *“Rabbit comes out of the hole, goes around the tree, and back into the hole.”*\n\n**To untie:** Push the collar to break the set, then pull the working end—bowlines are easy to release even after heavy load.\n",

    "generated_text": "# How visitors can “walk inside” the Akashi Kaikyō Bridge\n\nThere are two ways to go *inside* the bridge structure on the Kobe (Maiko) side:\n\n1. Maiko Marine Promenade (self-guided)\n\n* What it is: An enclosed observatory walkway built within the lower truss of the bridge. Long corridors with windows and a few glass-floor sections let you look straight down at the Akashi Strait—without being out in the wind.\n* How to do it: Enter from Maiko Park at the base of the bridge on the Kobe side, buy a ticket, and take the elevator up to the promenade level. It’s a simple come-and-go visit that most ages can do.\n* Good to know: It’s indoors and weather-sheltered. Expect museum-style exhibits, viewing lounges, and occasional glass-floor panels. Check local notices for opening days/hours and maintenance closures.\n\n2. “Bridge World” guided tour (for the adventurous)\n\n* What it is: A reservation-only tour run by the bridge authority. You gear up, walk along service catwalks inside the superstructure, and—on some itineraries—ride an internal elevator and stairs to the top of a main tower for a panorama over Kobe and Awaji.\n* How to do it: Book ahead, arrive on time for the safety briefing, and wear comfortable, closed-toe shoes. Capacity is limited and tours are weather-dependent.\n* Good to know: Age/health restrictions may apply; bags are often limited. Tours can be canceled for strong winds or rain.\n\nGetting there (quick orientation)\n\n* Aim for **Maiko Park** on the Kobe side of the strait. The nearest rail stops are around the Maiko area; from there it’s a short walk to the promenade entrance and the bridge exhibition facilities.\n\nTip\n\n* If you prefer an easy, family-friendly indoor stroll with big views, pick the **Maiko Marine Promenade**. If you want a behind-the-scenes engineering experience (and heights don’t bother you), try to snag a **Bridge World** tour.\n",

If it appears, stop just above that range.\n\n## 6) Drive Up\n\n* Push the floor away through mid-foot/heels.\n* Stand up by extending hips and knees together (no shooting hips up first).\n* Keep knees tracking over toes; exhale through the sticking point.\n\n## 7) Finish Tall\n\n* Stand tall with hips and knees fully extended.\n* Reset your breath/bracing before the next rep.\n\n---\n\n## Breathing Cue (Simple)\n\n* **Inhale & brace** before you descend → **exhale** as you drive up.\n* For heavier sets, you can hold a gentle brace until you pass the hardest point, then exhale.\n\n## Common Mistakes → Quick Fixes\n\n* **Heels lift:** Widen stance slightly; slow down; work ankle mobility; try a small heel lift (5–10 mm).\n* **Knees cave in:** Think “spread the floor” or “push knees toward pinky toes.”\n* **Back rounds:** Re-brace; keep chest proud; shorten depth slightly; include core work.\n* **Leaning too far forward:** Bring heels under hips; use counterbalance arms; keep gaze forward.\n* **Bouncing/relaxing at bottom:** Pause briefly; keep tension.\n\n## Regressions (Easier)\n\n* **Box/Chair Squat:** Tap a box/chair behind you for depth control.\n* **Supported Squat:** Hold a doorframe/TRX for assistance.\n* **Heel-elevated Squat:** Place thin plates under heels to ease ankle demand.\n\n## Helpful Progressions (Harder)\n\n* **Goblet Squat (light weight)** for counterbalance and torso position.\n* **Tempo Squat:** 3-sec lower, no bounce, smooth up.\n* **Pause Squat:** 1–2 sec hold at the bottom with tension.\n* **Split Squat / Pistol to Box** for single-leg control.\n\n## Suggested Sets & Reps\n\n* Beginners: **3 × 8–10 reps**, rest 60–90 s.\n* Warm-up: 5 min light cardio + 2–3 easy ramp-up sets.\n\n> Goal: Smooth, controlled reps with consistent depth and balance.

    "question": "How to Do a Cartwheel? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Picture an imaginary line extending straight in front of you. Use this line as a guide while you perform your cartwheel. You can even use painter’s tape to create a real line across a carpet or a mat . Make this line several feet long. Try to stay on the line, as if the line is a balance beam. As you focus on the line, be sure to keep your form in mind, too. Make sure the area around your line is free and clear. Avoid practicing cartwheels near walls or pieces of furniture that you might run into. Injuries occur when you bump into something hard. Stretch your arms and legs before practicing a cartwheel. This helps to stretch out your muscles and reduces the risk of injury. 2. Lunge forward with your lead leg and raise your arms. Slightly bend your front leg at the knee and keep your back leg straight. Keep both feet pointing forward parallel to your imaginary line. Hold your arms straight up by your ears. A common mistake is to start a cartwheel while facing sideways. Make sure you’re facing forwards as you prepare and start for your cartwheel. That is the correct way. Either leg can be your lead leg. Sometimes, however, it's more comfortable to use one leg instead of the other—you can try to figure out which one by doing a series of handstands, some starting with your right leg in front, others with your left. Whichever leading leg feels more natural is the one you should use for your cartwheel.You can determine your leading by watching which leg in splits feels more comfortable. 3. Lower your arms towards the ground while raising your back leg. Keep your arms straight by your ears as you lower them down to bring your head and torso down as well. Only lower your arms about halfway to the ground. Bring your back leg up while keeping it straight so your body forms a “T” shape. This step requires balance. You may need to drop your leg several times before you find a balanced position you can hold. Don’t worry if you’re having trouble balancing. Once you get the hang of the cartwheel, you won’t have to hold this position for very long since it will all become one continuous and natural movement. 4. Place your hands on the mat as you turn your body sideways. Put down the arm on the same side of your body as your lead leg first. Then put your other arm down so they're spread about shoulder width apart, similar to the way they would be positioned for a handstand. Place both hands along the imaginary line. Think \"hand hand feet\" to help you process the cartwheel. For example, if you lunged with your right leg, place your right hand down first, then your left hand. Keep the fingers of each hand pointing away from your head. 5. Push off on your front leg, then bring your legs up in a V shape. Straighten your front leg as you push so your legs end up in the air, pointing straight upwards. Balance your weight on your arms with your hands shoulder-width apart on either side of your head. Keep your head and torso upside down and positioned directly over your arms. Use your shoulders and core for support. You won’t hold this position for long. Cartwheels should be performed in one fluid motion. Make sure to keep your legs straight the whole time. If you are a beginner, then you may want to practice more. 6. Lower your lead leg as you lift the first hand you put down off the mat. To complete the cartwheel, put your leading leg down first along your imaginary line. The first hand you placed on the mat will lift up naturally as your foot comes down. Bring your arm up by your ear to finish the cartwheel. Your weight should start to shift onto your legs. Keep your head and torso roughly parallel to the mat. 7. Bring your other leg down while lifting your other hand off the mat. Your other leg will follow the first as it comes down. Make sure to place your back foot behind your leading foot along the same imaginary line so both feet point back in the direction you came from. Your second hand will lift naturally off the mat, following the first hand. At this point, both your head and torso should be right side up, centered over your legs. A common mistake while cartwheeling is leaving your hands on the ground for too long. Make sure that your arms stay straight and by your ears as your chest and head come up at the end of the cartwheel. 8. Land in a lunge facing in the opposite direction. Position yourself so your original back leg is in front and slightly bent, while your original leading leg is behind you and straight, just like a lunge. Keep both feet pointing in the direction you came from. Make sure your arms are straight and pointing upwards, next to your ears. Position your torso in the same direction your feet are pointing.",

Respiration involves taking in air filled with oxygen into the human body or lungs and releasing carbon dioxide from the body. Respiration involves breathing through the nose/nasal cavity. The air then travels down into the lungs through the pharynx, followed by the larynx and finally through the trachea. The lungs are located in the chest cavity or thoracic cavity along with the heart. The chest cavity are covered by ribs on the outside. The pleura lines the thoracic cavity and envelopes the lungs. The trachea is subdivided into two bronchi before it enters the lungs. The bronchi are further divided into tiny bronchioles inside the lungs. The bronchioles have a tree like structure. The lungs are separated from the abdominal cavity by the diaphragm. The diaphragm contracts while breathing in and relaxes when breathing out.

Inhalation (breathing in)\n\n* The diaphragm contracts and moves downward while the external intercostal muscles lift the ribs.\n* This expands the chest cavity, lowering the pressure inside the lungs below outside air pressure.\n* Air flows in through the **nose or mouth** → **pharynx** (throat) → **larynx** (voice box) → **trachea** (windpipe) → splits into **right and left bronchi** → smaller **bronchioles** → tiny air sacs called **alveoli**.\n\n2. Gas exchange in the alveoli\n\n* Each alveolus is wrapped in a web of capillaries.\n* **Oxygen (O₂)** diffuses from the air in the alveoli into the blood (where it binds to hemoglobin).\n* **Carbon dioxide (CO₂)** diffuses from the blood into the alveoli to be exhaled.\n\n3. Exhalation (breathing out)\n\n* The diaphragm relaxes and moves upward; the rib cage falls.\n* Chest volume decreases, pressure inside the lungs rises above outside air pressure.\n* Air flows out along the same path in reverse: **alveoli → bronchioles → bronchi → trachea → larynx → pharynx → nose/mouth**.\n* At rest this is mostly passive; during hard breathing, abdominal and internal intercostal muscles actively squeeze air out.\n\n4. Built-in protections & helpers\n\n* **Nasal hairs, mucus, and cilia** trap dust and pathogens and sweep them upward to be swallowed or coughed out.\n* The **epiglottis** guides food away from the airway when you swallow.\n* **C-shaped cartilage rings** in the trachea keep it open.\n\n5. Quick glossary\n\n* **Diaphragm:** dome-shaped muscle under the lungs that powers breathing.\n* **Alveoli:** tiny air sacs where gas exchange happens.\n* **Bronchi/bronchioles:** branching airways that distribute air within the lungs.\n\nIf you’d like, I can add callouts for common issues (like asthma narrowing the bronchioles) or show how exercise changes breathing mechanics.\n\n*(The labeled diagram image is provided separately above.)*\n",

The break starts at the hypocenter (focus) at depth and spreads along the fault.\n4.\tSeismic waves: Stored elastic energy radiates as P and S waves that shake the ground. The point on the surface above the focus is the epicenter.\n5.\tAftershocks: The crust adjusts to the new positions, producing smaller quakes on or near the same fault.\n\nMain fault types & the stresses that create them:\n•\tNormal fault (tension/extension): Crust is pulled apart; the hanging wall moves down.\n•\tReverse/thrust fault (compression): Crust is squeezed; the hanging wall moves up (common in subduction zones and mountain belts).\n•\tStrike-slip fault (shear): Blocks slide horizontally past each other (e.g., transform boundaries); motion can be right-lateral or left-lateral.\n\nWhy some places shake more:\nMost large earthquakes occur at plate boundaries where stress accumulates fastest: subduction zones (big thrust quakes), continental collisions (reverse faults), and major transforms (strike-slip).\n\nImage generated separately above: labeled diagram showing a fault plane, the earthquake cycle with hypocenter/epicenter and waves, plus normal/reverse/strike-slip fault insets.",

    "question": "How to Connect One Router to Another to Expand a Network？ Provide steps with images and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Connect the modem to the first router. Use an Ethernet cable to connect to the WAN port of a router to the WAN/Internet port of the high-speed modem. For the purpose of this wikiHow, we will refer to the router that’s connected to the modem as “Router 1.\" Some routers act as a high-speed modem and router. If this is the case for Router 1, simply connect it to the cable that carries your internet connection. The WAN port may be labeled “Internet.” 2. Connect Router 1 to a computer. Use an Ethernet cable to connect from one of Router 1’s LAN ports to a computer’s Ethernet port. You can also connect to the router wirelessly using the wi-fi name and passkey. 3. Turn on the modem and Router 1. Allow a few moments for them both to boot up. 4. Open a web browser. You’ll need a web browser to connect to the admin user interface of Router 1. 5. Enter Router 1's IP address in the address bar. Type the IP address for Router 1 into the address bar at the top of your web browser. This opens the router's admin login screen. Check the user's manual or manufacturer's website to find the default IP address for Router 1. Here are some default IP addresses for common router brands: 2Wire: 192.168.1.1, 192.168.0.1, 192.168.1.254, 10.0.0.138 Apple: 10.0.0.1 Belkin: 192.168.1.1, 192.168.2.1, 10.0.0.2, 10.1.1.1 Dlink: 192.168.1.1, 192.168.0.1, 192.168.0.101, 192.168.0.30, 192.168.0.50, 192.168.15.1, 192.168.254.254, 192.168.1.254, 192.168.0.10, 192.168.15.1, 10.0.0.1, 10.0.0.2, 10.1.1.1, 10.90.90.90, Netgear: 192.168.0.1, 192.168.0.227 6. Log in using Router 1's admin username and password. This opens Router 1's admin user interface. Check the user's manual, or the manufacturer's website to find the default username and password for the Router 1. Most router's use \"admin\" as the username and password. You can also try \"Password\" or \"12345678\" as the password. For some router's, the username or password is left blank. If you’re using the right password but still can’t connect, check the user's manual or manufacturer's website to learn how to reset the router's to it's factory settings. 7. Enable DHCP on Router 1. This will allow Router 1 to assign all of the IP addresses in your network. You can usually find these settings under “Network settings,” or “LAN settings.” The admin user interface layout is different from one router make and model to another. In most cases, the DHCP server is turned on by default. 8. Test your network and internet connection. [6] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source Visit any website (like https://www.wikihow.com ) to verify that you can connect to the Internet. Make sure that the physical configuration of your network leaves room for one LAN port to be open on Router 1. 9. Disconnect Router 1 from the computer. Remove the Ethernet cable between Router 1 and the computer. Everything else can remain on and plugged in. 10. Plug the second router in and turn it on. Make sure you have a free electrical outlet and a computer near where you want the second router to be located. Plug it in and turn it on. For the purposes of this wikiHow, we will refer to the second router as \"Router 2\". 11. Connect a computer to the Router 2. Use an Ethernet cable to connect to the LAN port on Router 2. Then connect to the Ethernet port on a computer. 12. Type Router 2's IP address in the address bar of a web browser. This opens the admin login screen for Router 2. With most router's, the IP address is 192.168.0.1, 192.168.1.1, or 10.0.0.1. 13. Log in using Router 2's username and password. Use the default username and password to log in to the admin user interface for Router 2, just as you did with Router 1. Check the user's manual or manufacturer's website to find the default username and password. With most routers, \"admin\" is both the username and password. 14. Disable DHCP on Router 2. Since DHCP is enabled on Router 1, it should be disabled on Router 2 to prevent IP conflicts. Locate the DHCP settings in the admin user interface and switch the DHCP server to “Off.” 15. Assign a new IP address to Router 2. As of now, there’s a good possibility that Routers 1 and 2 have the same default IP address. To prevent IP conflicts, Router 2 needs to have a different IP address than Router 1. Find the area in the routers admin user interface called “LAN” or “Local Network.” There should be a box that contains the current IP address. Type a new IP address in place of the existing one. The new IP address on Router 2 must be on the same subnet as Router 1. This means the first three sets of numbers in the IP address should be the same as Router 1. Change the number after the third period in the IP address to something different from Router 1. It also can’t be an IP currently assigned to another device. 16. Configure Router 2's Wi-Fi name and passkey. They should be identical to Router 1. You should find these settings under a menu called “Wireless”, “Wi-Fi setup”, or something similar If you’re unsure of Router 1’s SSID and passkey, it should be printed on the device. Router 2 is not a wireless router, skip this step. 17. Disconnect the power from Router 2. Now that Router 2’s all set up, it’s a good idea to give it a restart—though, for now, leave the power unplugged instead of turning it right back on. 18. Connect the first router to the second router. Use an Ethernet cable to connect to a LAN port on Router 1. Then connect to the first LAN port on Router 2. Make sure you’re not plugging it into the WAN port as they look similar. 19. Plug Router 2 back in and turn it on. When the router comes back up, it will have the IP address you configured. As long as Router 1 has Internet access, Router 2 will now also be online. 20. Restart the computer that’s connected to Router 2. Anytime you connect a computer to a new network device, it's a good idea to restart your computer. 21. Connect other computers and devices. This can be done wirelessly , or by connecting Ethernet cables to unused LAN ports on either router. Router 1’s DHCP server will automatically assign each device its own IP address in the same subnet. Enjoy your expanded network!",

If you want any of them tweaked—colors, labels, or brand-specific screenshots—say the word and I’ll regenerate.)\n\n1. **Overview: Two Ways to Connect One Router to Another**\n2. **LAN-to-LAN (Access Point mode) – step-by-step**\n3. **LAN-to-WAN (Router-behind-Router) – step-by-step**\n4. **Placement & Channel Planning**\n\n# Text Steps\n\n## Before you start\n\n* **Pick your method**\n\n  * **LAN-to-LAN (Access Point/AP mode)** — one big network, seamless roaming. *Recommended for most homes.*\n  * **LAN-to-WAN (Double NAT)** — creates a second, isolated network. *Good for guests, kids, or separating work gear.*\n* **What you need**: Router 1 (already on the internet), Router 2, one Ethernet cable (Cat5e or better), a laptop/phone to configure Router 2.\n\n---\n\n## Option A — LAN-to-LAN (Access Point/AP mode)  *(matches Image 2)*\n\nThis turns Router 2 into a simple access point/switch on the **same** network as Router 1.\n\n1. **Connect to Router 2**\n   Plug your laptop into a LAN port on Router 2 (or join its default Wi-Fi). Open its admin page.\n\n2. **Set Router 2 a fixed LAN IP on Router 1’s subnet**\n\n   * Example: if **Router 1** is `192.168.1.1` and its DHCP pool is `192.168.1.100–192.168.1.199`, set **Router 2** to **`192.168.1.2`**.\n   * Aim for an address **outside** Router 1’s DHCP pool to avoid conflicts.\n\n3. **Turn off DHCP on Router 2**\n   Router 1 will be the only device handing out addresses.\n\n4. **Wi-Fi settings on Router 2**\n\n   * For seamless roaming: **same SSID and password** as Router 1.\n   * Set **different channels** to reduce interference:\n\n     * 2.4 GHz: use **1/6/11** (pick a different one than Router 1).\n     * 5 GHz: pick a different channel band (auto is usually fine).\n\n5. **Wire it LAN-to-LAN**\n   Run an Ethernet cable from a **LAN port** on Router 1 to a **LAN port** on Router 2 (do **not** use Router 2’s WAN port).\n\n6. **Place Router 2 well**\n   Put it roughly midway between dead zones and Router 1 (see Image 4). Avoid metal cabinets, microwaves, and thick concrete walls.\n\n7. **Test**\n   Walk around with your phone—signal should stay strong and your device should keep one IP range (e.g., `192.168.1.x`).\n\n---\n\n## Option B — LAN-to-WAN (Router-behind-Router / Double NAT)  *(matches Image 3)*\n\nThis keeps Router 2 as a full router on a **different** subnet. Devices on Router 2 are isolated from Router 1 unless you add special rules.\n\n1. **Connect to Router 2**\n   Log into the admin page.\n\n2. **Use a different LAN subnet on Router 2**\n\n   * Example: leave **Router 1** at `192.168.1.1`.\n   * Set **Router 2** LAN to **`192.168.2.1`** (or any different private subnet). Keep **DHCP ON** on Router 2.\n\n3. **Wire it LAN-to-WAN**\n   Cable from a **LAN port** on Router 1 to the **WAN/Internet** port on Router 2. WAN on Router 2 should be set to **DHCP/Automatic**.\n\n4. **Wi-Fi settings**\n\n   * You can reuse the same SSID/password or choose a **different** name to make it clear which network is which (e.g., “Home-Guest”).\n\n5. **Test**\n   Devices on Router 2 should receive `192.168.2.x` addresses and have internet.\n   *(Note: gaming consoles, servers, or VPNs may need extra port forwarding because of double NAT.)*\n\n---\n\n## Quick Troubleshooting\n\n* **Can’t reach Router 2 after changing its IP?**\n  Temporarily set your laptop to a manual IP on that subnet (e.g., `192.168.1.10`) and browse to Router 2’s new address.\n* **IP conflict or no internet in AP mode?**\n  Make sure **DHCP is OFF** on Router 2 and its IP doesn’t sit inside Router 1’s DHCP pool.\n* **Wi-Fi drops or poor speeds?**\n  Move Router 2 farther from Router 1 and use different channels (1/6/11 on 2.4 GHz).\n* **Double NAT issues (Option B)**\n  If a device needs inbound connections (server, P2P, gaming), add **port forwarding** on **both** routers or switch to **Option A**.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n* For one seamless home network, use **Option A (LAN-to-LAN/AP mode)**.\n* For a segregated guest or work network, use **Option B (LAN-to-WAN/Double NAT)**.\n\nIf you tell me your current router’s IP and DHCP range, I can plug in exact values for you.\n\",",

    "reference_text": "1. Find the appropriate keys on your keyboard. Windows 10 PCs allow you to adjust your brightness using hotkeys on your keyboard. These hotkeys are represented by two different images of a sun, one for increasing and another for decreasing brightness. Find the keys on your keyboard to get started. These hotkeys will look slightly different on every computer. They are often differentiated by a filled-in sun (decrease) and an empty sun (increase) or a sun with dots for rays (decrease) and a sun with lines for rays (increase). Also be on the lookout for arrows pointing upwards or downwards, indicating an increase or decrease in brightness. These hotkeys will be mapped onto different buttons on different keyboards. Check out your left and right arrow keys, or the function keys (F1, F2, etc.) lining the top of your keyboard. 2. Hold down the \"Fn\" key on your keyboard. The brightness hotkeys are not the primary function of the keys they are mapped onto. You'll therefore needed to hold down the Fn key while you adjust your screen's brightness. 3. Tap the appropriate hotkeys. While holding Fn , tap the corresponding hotkeys to turn your PC's brightness up or down.",
