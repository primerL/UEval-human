    "reference_text": "1. 1. Start with two tall hill shapes. Add a curve underneath each shape, then draw ovals inside each shape with a circle cut out of the ovals. 2. 2. Draw a curve above each eye with an oval in the middle. 3. 3. Add a line underneath the nose, then sketch a hook shape on either side. 4. 4. Draw a curve underneath the cartoon puppy face's mouth. 5. 5. Sketch a curve on either side of the face. 6. 6. Draw a rectangle with rounded edges to outline the head. 7. 7. Outline an oval for the right ear. Make sure the oval is behind the face. 8. 8. Repeat the previous step for the left ear. 9. 9. Use a wavy shape to draw a patch around your puppy face's eye. Finally, outline your easy dog face with black. Use thick lines for most of the drawing and a thin line for the patch. If you like, add a dog biscuit to give your dog a treat. 10. You can fill in your easy dog face with any color, but this guide recommends using tan for the face and dark brown for the ears, nose and patch. Leave the eyes white, and add a white highlight to the nose.",

Clean outline\n   Trace the circle cleanly (keep guidelines faint so you can erase them later).\n\n3. Eyes\n   Place two big oval eyes on the horizontal guideline, spaced about one eye-width apart. Add tiny highlights (white dots) to make them lively.\n\n4. Nose & muzzle\n   Under the eye line, draw a small upside-down triangle nose. From the sides of the nose, curve two lines down and around to form a soft “W” for the cheeks and a small smile. Add a little tongue if you like.\n\n5. Ears\n   Add two floppy, rounded triangle ears attached near the top sides of the head.\n\n6. Details\n   Add short eyebrow curves above the eyes, a small chin line, and three tiny whisker dots on each cheek (optional).\n\n7. Refine the smile\n   Thicken the mouth line slightly and round the cheeks so it looks friendly. Erase the guidelines.\n\n8. Finish\n   Add a collar and tag under the chin if desired. You can also add a patch around one eye or a few spots. Ink your final lines and color if you want.\n\nTips:\n\n* Keep everything round and soft for a cute look.\n* If you want a different breed vibe, change the ear shape (pointy for a husky, long and thin for a hound).\n* Eyes higher = younger/cuter; eyes lower = older/goofier.\n\nIf you want, I can also make a printable worksheet version.\n",

Outline the triangular shape of the eye using curved lines, then shade the round pupil inside. Detail the skin above and below the eye with curved lines. 2. 2. Use overlapping curved lines to sketch the trunk, mouth, and jaw. Notice the tusk overlapping the trunk. To draw the tusk, extend a curved line from just in front of the mouth and double it back upon itself. 3. 3. Complete the trunk using a long curved line. Note the “C” shape of the prehensile tip of the trunk. Then, enclose the ear using a long curved line. 4. 4. Enclose the remaining ear and trunk, using a curved line for each. Detail the ears with curved lines, and use another curved line to begin sketching the elephant’s chest. 5. 5. Draw the foreleg. Use a pair of roughly parallel curved lines that form a loose zigzag shape. Connect them at the bottom with a curved line. Use “U” shaped lines to indicate the toenails. 6. 6. Draw the rear leg. Again, use a pair of curved lines and connect them at the bottom. Detail the toes with “U” shaped lines. Connect the tops of each leg with a curved line, forming the belly. 7. 7. Draw the remaining foreleg. Use curved lines and connect them at the bottom. Then, extend a long curved line from the ear to the top of the rear leg to enclose the body. Detail the shoulder and hip with curved lines. 8. 8. Use a curved line to enclose the remaining rear leg, partially hidden behind the first. Draw the toenails on both the front and rear legs. Extend two curved lines from the back of the body and allow them to meet at a point, forming the tail. 9. 9. Use curved lines that meet at jagged points to enclose a tuft of hair at the tip. 10.

They should meet in a gentle curve on the top end, but they should not connect on the bottom end. This outlines the body, or fuselage, of the rocket. 3. 3. Enclose the open end of the rocket using a pair of straight lines. 4. 4. Band the nose cone with two pairs of curved parallel lines. 5. 5. Draw portholes, or small windows, along the side of the rocket. To do so, draw several circles of different sizes. 6. 6. Draw the rocket's fin. First, draw a straight line from the tail of the rocket to its middle. Then, draw curved lines downward from each end of the straight line. Allow the curved lines to meet at a gentle point. 7. 7. Erase guide lines from the fin. 8. 8. Draw the rocket's second fin. To do so, extend two curved lines from the top side of the rocket - one emerging from the middle of the ship, the other from its base. Allow the lines to meet at a gentle point. 9. 9. Draw the flames, called exhaust, coming from the rocket's nozzle, or base. Use a series of short curved lines that meet in jagged points to draw a rounded triangular shape. Then, use another series of lines to draw a second layer. Finally, draw the third layer of the exhaust, allowing it to end at a point. 10. Color your rocket. Rockets such as the one in this drawing guide were popular illustrations during the 1950s and 1960s. Some were silver in color, while others had bright red, blue, or other colored markings.",

    "question": "How to hand-wash delicate clothing safely? Provide a visual guide and text the steps. ",
    "reference_text": "1. The tags on your clothes tell you the best ways to clean them. Read through the tag on each garment that you’re washing to see what fabric it’s made from and how to clean it properly. Keep similar fabrics together so you can wash them at the same time. Anything that can go in your machine or that has a “hand wash only” label is safe for hand-washing. If a tag says “dry clean only,” then avoid hand-washing that garment to avoid damaging it. As a quick way to check if your garments are safe to hand-wash, place a drop of water on the fabric and blot it up with a paper towel. If the color runs or bleeds, then take it to the dry cleaners. 2. Washing similar garments in the same load prevents colors from running. Sort your laundry so all the light fabrics are separated from the dark ones. Since darker colors could potentially discolor the water, wash the lightest colored clothes first and save the darker ones for last. If you have a new item of clothing that is dyed or colored, wash it separately in a different tub or basin so the color does not get on other clothing. 3. Using a stain remover beforehand makes it easier to wash out. Apply the stain remover directly over the mark on your clothes. Gently dab the stain with your fingers or brush it lightly with a new toothbrush to work the cleaner deeper into the fabric. Let the stain remover sit for about 10–15 minutes before you wash your garment. Test the stain remover in a small inconspicuous spot on your clothes before applying it directly to the stain. 4. A mild detergent meant for delicates cleans clothes more gently. Use your bathtub, sink, or large bowl depending on how many clothes you need to wash. Stick with cool or lukewarm water when you wash your clothes to prevent colors from running. Mix about 1 1 ⁄ 2 fluid ounces (44 ml) of detergent into the water until it’s completely dissolved and forms suds. [5] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Wool and fine knits: Use cold water and wool detergent to keep the fabric soft. Silk or lace: Try a no-rinse detergent to limit how much water comes in contact with the fabric. Alternatively, use mild liquid dish soap if you’re in a pinch. 5. Gently stirring the water is less damaging to clothes than scrubbing. Drop your first load of clothes into the water so they’re submerged. Then, use your hands to gently move the clothes around to wash out the dirt between the fibers. Keep agitating the water for about 2–3 minutes, or until the clothes look clean. Sweaters: Turn sweaters inside-out before washing them to clean them better. Avoid scrubbing, twisting, or rubbing your clothes together when you hand-wash them since you could stretch and damage the fabric. 6. Soaking helps lift dirt and stains deep in the fabric. Leave your clothes submerged for at least 10 minutes so the detergent has time to work through the fabric. If your clothes are really dirty or have stubborn stains, leave them in the water for up to 30 minutes so it’s even more effective. It’s normal for the water to darken as dirt lifts out of the fabric. If the water ever looks really cloudy or dirty, empty it out and refill your container. 7. A thorough rinse removes all the detergent and leftover dirt. Either empty out your container and refill it with clean water, or hold your garments underneath a running faucet. Gently squeeze your clothes as you rinse them until you don’t see any more suds coming out. Alternatively, fill a second container with clean water and transfer your clothes over to rinse them. 8. Gently squeezing your clothes prevents them from stretching. Hold your garments above the water when you squeeze them so you don’t drip. then, lay your garment flat on a towel and slowly roll the towel up to squeeze out even more water. Avoid twisting or wringing out your clothes too forcefully since you’ll stretch or damage the fabric fibers. 9. Drying your clothes flat helps them preserve their shape. While T-shirts and pants are safe to hang dry, delicate fabrics could stretch or distort. When you’re washing sweaters, silks, bras, or lingerie, spread the garments flat so they’re shaped correctly. Keep them in a well-ventilated spot and flip your clothes over after 1–2 hours so the other side can dry. Turn a fan on in the same room as your clothes to help them dry faster. Avoid putting your clothes in the dryer unless the care tag says it’s safe. Otherwise, your clothes may get damaged or shrink.",

If it says “dry clean only,” see the notes below.\n* **Sort by color & fabric.** Wash darks separately; don’t mix heavy knits with ultra-sheer pieces.\n* **Close zippers/hooks** and turn garments inside out.\n\n## Step-by-step\n\n1. **Fill the basin** with cool/lukewarm water.\n2. **Add detergent:** about **1 tsp (5 mL) per 2 L** of water (≈½ Tbsp per gallon). Swirl to dissolve.\n3. **Pre-treat spots:** dab a drop of diluted detergent on the stain; tap gently; **test in a hidden seam** first.\n4. **Submerge the garment.** Gently press out air so it’s fully wet.\n5. **Soak** for **10 minutes** (silk: 3–5 minutes).\n6. **Agitate lightly** for **30–60 seconds**—swish and squeeze the water through the fabric. **No rubbing or wringing.**\n7. **Rinse**: drain, refill with cool water, and press water through the fabric until it runs clear (repeat as needed).\n\n   * Optional final rinse: **1 Tbsp white vinegar per gallon** to reduce residue and static (skip for garments with metal trims).\n8. **Remove excess water:** lift with two hands; press against the side of the basin. **Do not twist.**\n9. **Towel-roll:** lay flat on a clean towel, roll it up, and press along the roll to absorb water.\n10. **Dry properly:**\n\n    * **Knits/wool/cashmere:** lay flat on a dry towel or rack, **reshape** to measurements.\n    * **Lingerie/synthetics:** hang or lay on a rack; avoid clothespin dents (use padded hangers).\n    * Keep away from **direct sun or heat**; **never tumble-dry** delicates.\n\n## Fabric-specific tips\n\n* **Silk:** cool water, pH-neutral detergent, short soak; blot, then lay flat or hang to drip; press inside-out with a cool iron under a pressing cloth when nearly dry.\n* **Wool & cashmere:** cold–cool water with wool wash; avoid temperature shock; always flat-dry.\n* **Lace/tulle/beaded items:** place in a **mesh bag**, minimal agitation, flat-dry.\n* **Athletic synthetics:** avoid fabric softener (it reduces wicking); hang-dry.\n\n## Stain quick help\n\n* **Protein (blood, milk):** cold water only; dab, don’t rub.\n* **Oils/grease:** pre-treat with a small drop of detergent; let sit 5–10 min, then wash.\n* **Makeup/sunscreen:** dab with detergent solution; rinse well.\n* **Dye bleed:** if water tints, stop—rinse quickly and wash separately.\n\n## When to dry-clean instead\n\n* Structured or heavily **lined** garments, tailored suits, leather/suede, or items with heavy beading/embellishment. If unsure, test a seam first or choose professional care.\n\n## Common mistakes to avoid\n\n* Hot water, bleach, fabric softener on silk/wool, vigorous scrubbing, wringing/twisting, or drying in direct heat/sun.\n\n---\n\nIf you’d like, I can regenerate the visual as a different style (minimal icons, step photos, or dark theme) or add your specific fabrics.\n",

    "question": "How to Exfoliate Your Body for Soft Skin? Provide a visual guide and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Have a bath or shower. While not part of the exfoliating process per se, immersing your body in hot water will open up your pores, making your skin much more susceptible to cleaning. It also helps to do this process in the bathroom, as you'll need a ready supply of hot water and somewhere to wash away the dead skin flakes once they've been scrubbed off. Use a skin-friendly, perfume-free detergent for bath and allow at least 15 minutes to soften (macerating) the skin surface. It is good when the skin surface looks a bit \"deformed\". Remove \"dead skin\" by rubbing it away with your hands. It will work well, especially at your feet, toes and heels. 2. Get a textured sponge to wash your skin. Tending to your skin with it will help rub away excess skin flakes, leaving your skin softer and cleaner than before. It is recommended you have a sponge ready for use once you have finished up your shower. It should feel slightly rough on your skin, but if it's abrasive to the point of pain, exfoliating wash cloths are a suitable, gentler alternative. Exfoliating can also be done with a rough washcloth. A natural bristle brush makes for a good alternative, particularly while scrubbing the backs of arms or legs. If you're the do-it-yourself type, you might look into making your own loofah from home. 3. Scrub your body gently with your sponge starting from the ankles upward. Scrub the sponge over your skin in small, circular motions. Make sure to apply some pressure to feel the sponge's rough texture on your skin; that way, it will rub the surface-layer dead skin away. Starting at the ankles is recommended because it helps to encourage positive blood circulation during the exfoliation process. healthglamour.com/how-to-exfoliate-the-body/ If you're exfoliating your entire body, make sure to give extra attention to your heels, elbows, and knees. These are generally considered to be the driest parts of one's skin, and should be given greater attention accordingly. 4. Add wet sand or salt to your full body exfoliation. If you've ever walked along the beach barefoot, you may have noticed your foot callouses soften. Sand granules are a naturally occurring exfoliant, and their grainy texture is well-suited to scraping away your excess skin flakes. Salt scrubs do the same thing. You can find sand and salt exfoliating products at any store that sells beauty and skincare products. Be forewarned: Using sand in the bath can cause a bigger mess than more common exfoliants. Although it is recommended to try it out at least once, it may not be the best course of action if you don't have the added time in your routine available to do a bit of cleaning up afterwards. Getting sand down a drain could completely ruin the plumbing pipes if done often. If using sand, it should be cleaned, even bleached, because getting it from outdoors could introduce bacteria and using that to exfoliate would do more harm than good. Choose sand with small granules, not big, because the smaller granules are more gentle on the skin. Focus on the tougher skin of the arms and legs because sand can be more intense than exfoliating scrubs. 5. Rinse with hot water. Closing up shop with a body rinse is a relaxing and effective way to finish your exfoliation. Although it's recommended you repeat this process at least three times a week, you should notice an immediate softness with your skin. Applying a moisturizer or shea butter following your rinse, even following an otherwise purely 'mechanical' cleanse, will help your skin better retain moisture.",

Skip if skin is inflamed.\n* **Chemical (acids/actives):**\n\n  * **AHAs** (lactic, glycolic): dry/dull or uneven texture.\n  * **BHA** (salicylic): body breakouts, clogged pores, ingrowns.\n  * **PHA** (gluconolactone, lactobionic): very sensitive skin.\n  * **Urea** (10–20%): rough bumps/keratosis pilaris (KP).\n\n## 2) Step-by-step routine (shower days)\n\n1. **Soak** in warm (not hot) water for 5–10 min.\n2. **Cleanse** with a gentle, non-stripping body wash.\n3. **Exfoliate**\n\n   * *Physical:* massage with light pressure in small circles for 30–60 sec per area; avoid chest/neck if sensitive.\n   * *Chemical:* apply a thin layer per label. Rinse-off: 1–3 min. Leave-on lotions: use a light, even coat—don’t scrub.\n4. **Rinse & pat dry** (don’t rub).\n5. **Moisturize within 3 minutes.** Look for glycerin, hyaluronic acid, ceramides; for very dry skin, seal with a light oil/occlusive.\n6. **Daytime SPF 30+** on exposed areas (AHAs/BHAs increase sun sensitivity).\n\n## 3) How often?\n\n* **Sensitive:** 1×/week (soft cloth or PHA).\n* **Normal/combination:** 1–2×/week.\n* **Dry/KP-prone:** 2–3×/week (lactic acid or urea, avoid gritty scrubs).\n* **Oily/acne-prone:** 2–3×/week BHA on problem zones (back, chest).\n\n> Signs you’re overdoing it: stinging that lasts, tightness, shiny but fragile skin, more redness or breakouts. Cut back to once weekly.\n\n## 4) Do’s & don’ts\n\n**Do**\n\n* Use gentle pressure; let products do the work.\n* Rinse mitts/cloths after each use; wash weekly; replace loofahs monthly.\n* Exfoliate **before** shaving (same session is OK for gentle physical or mild rinse-off acids).\n* Moisturize every time.\n\n**Don’t**\n\n* Exfoliate on sunburn, open cuts, or active eczema/psoriasis flares.\n* Mix strong actives on the same day (e.g., retinoids + strong acids).\n* Exfoliate right after waxing/laser; wait **48–72 hours**.\n* Use very hot water.\n\n## 5) Targeted tips\n\n* **Ingrown hairs/razor bumps:** Use BHA 0.5–2% the day **before** shaving and again 24–48 h after; shave with slip (gel/cream) in hair-growth direction.\n* **Keratosis pilaris:** Daily urea 10–20% or lactic acid 5–12% lotion; brief gentle physical buffing 2–3×/week; be patient (4–6 weeks).\n* **Feet/elbows/knees:** Can tolerate slightly stronger scrubs—keep separate tools for feet.\n\n## 6) Simple weekly template\n\n* **Mon:** BHA on back/chest after shower → moisturize.\n* **Wed:** Gentle washcloth buff head-to-toe → moisturize.\n* **Fri:** Lactic-acid or urea body lotion (leave-on) at night.\n* **Sun (optional):** Spot-treat rough patches only.\n\n*Friendly reminder:* If you’re pregnant/nursing or on prescription topicals, check product safety first. Stop and consult a professional if you develop a rash, severe burning, or infection.\n",

    "reference_text": "1. Rinse your board right after using it. Rinse your board with water right after you use it, rather than waiting until the end of the meal or even the next day when you clean it. This will help minimize bacteria growth and keep your board cleaner. Resist the urge to throw your board in the sink after the meal and forget about it. 2. Clean your board with dish soap and hot water. To clean your cutting board, scrub it with a few drops of dish soap on a sponge and some hot water. [2] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview Be sure to remove any food particles as you wash, paying particular attention to any grooves or scrapes in your board. Food can collect in these spots. Never clean a wooden cutting board in the dishwasher or soak it in water. The wood will absorb water, which can lead to bacteria and mold forming. [4] X Expert Source James Sears House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview 3. Rinse your board. Rinse your board to remove any traces of soap. You don’t want whatever you cook next to taste like your dish soap. [5] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview 4. Dry your board thoroughly to prevent cracking. After you’re finished washing your cutting board, dry it thoroughly with a clean dishtowel, removing any excess water. This is particularly important if your board is made of wood, as they are more prone to cracks. 5. Use a combination of white vinegar and baking soda. To sanitize your cutting board after use, sprinkle it with some baking soda. Then, spray the baking soda–covered board with white vinegar. This will fizz, helping draw stains out of your board and deodorizing it. Let this mix sit for 5 minutes and then rinse your board with water, drying as normal. 6. Disinfect your board with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Just as hydrogen peroxide can clean a wound, it can also clean your cutting board. Sprinkle your board with 3% hydrogen peroxide solution, and let it stand for 1 minute to kill any surface bacteria. Then, rinse your board with water, and dry with a dishtowel as normal. [8] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview Hydrogen peroxide can bleach porous surfaces like wood. Don’t let the solution sit too long or it might fade your cutting board. 7. Remove stains with a scrub of coarse salt. For deep, set-in stains on your cutting board, use a coarse salt, such as kosher salt, as a scrub. [10] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview Wet a sponge and use a handful of salt to scour your board, focusing on any areas of discoloration. Rinse your board with water when finished, and dry with a clean towel. [11] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview Be sure to wash your hands well and moisturize them with lotion after scrubbing your board with salt. It can be very drying. Another option is wearing kitchen gloves. 8. Wash your board with diluted bleach once a month. Especially if you work with raw meats and fish on your cutting board, use a diluted bleach solution to do a deep clean of your board once a month. Make a solution that’s 1/8th bleach and 7/8ths water. Wet a sponge, and scrub your board with the solution. Rinse well with plain water and dry your board as normal with a clean towel. 9. Rub your board with a lemon to deodorize once a week. To keep your board smelling fresh, use half of a cut lemon to deodorize your board. Rub the cut-side of the lemon along the length of the board side to side. Then, rinse with plain water, and dry with a clean towel. 10. Condition your cutting board weekly. If your cutting board is made of wood, use mineral oil to condition your board after it’s clean. This will keep it in optimal condition. Do not use organic oils or fats, which can turn rancid, to lubricate your board. Look for products labeled kitchen-grade white mineral oil, such as Howard’s Cutting Board Oil. There are other mineral oils meant for lubricating machinery but not for consumption. Look specifically for kitchen-grade oil. You can condition your board every time you clean it, or a minimum of once a week. Simply rub your board with the conditioner, and let it air try so the oil can soak in.",

Place a damp towel under the board so it won’t slip.\n\n2. **Remove crown & base**\n\n* Lay the pineapple on its side. Slice off about ½ inch from the top (crown) and bottom to make flat ends.\n\n3. **Stand and peel**\n\n* Stand it upright. Following the curve of the fruit, slice downward in long strips to remove the skin. Keep cuts shallow to save fruit.\n\n4. **Remove the “eyes”**\n\n* You’ll see brown “eyes” left in diagonal rows. Make shallow V-shaped notches along those diagonals (or shave them off) until the flesh is clean.\n\n5. **Choose your cut**\n\n* **Method A — Rings:** Lay the pineapple on its side and slice crosswise into ½-inch discs. Use a small round cutter or a paring knife to remove the hard core circle from each disc.\n* **Method B — Spears & Chunks:** Stand it up. Cut in half lengthwise, then into quarters. Lay each quarter flat and slice off the tough core (a pale, fibrous triangle) from the center edge. Cut quarters into long spears, then into bite-size chunks.\n\n6. **Serve or store**\n\n* Eat right away, or refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 3–4 days. For longer storage, freeze chunks on a tray, then bag.\n\n**Tips**\n\n* A ripe pineapple smells sweet at the base and yields slightly when pressed.\n* For cleaner cuts, wipe juice from the board as you go.\n* Try a sprinkle of lime and chili powder, or grill spears 1–2 minutes per side for caramelization.\n\n(Visual guide generated separately above.)\n",

In practical terms:\n\n* **Purpose-built infrastructure:** Catwalks, handrails, and grated steps were added to sections of the steel arch, along with a **continuous safety line** so climbers can stay clipped in the entire time.\n* **Professional supervision:** Trained climb leaders run small groups, give a pre-climb briefing, fit harnesses and lanyards, and manage radio comms and pacing on the route.\n* **Risk controls:** Full-body harnesses, checks for health/fitness and sobriety, strict weather protocols, and rules limiting loose items (so nothing can drop onto the roadway) keep the activity controlled.\n* **Bridge suitability:** The Story Bridge’s robust steel design and existing maintenance access points make it feasible to adapt for tourism while respecting the bridge’s heritage and daily use.\n* **Tourism & education value:** The climb offers panoramic views over the Brisbane River and CBD and includes local history commentary—so the city permits it as a regulated attraction.\n\n(Details like age/height/health requirements and session times vary; the operator specifies them during booking.)\n",

    "question": "How to Smash in Badminton? Show visual steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Approach the shuttlecock with a forehand grip . Be on your toes and ready to return the shuttle with a smash at any instant. You never know when a smash-worthy shot will present itself. When the shuttle is hit to your end of the court, get underneath and behind it as quickly as possible. The sooner you reach the spot where the shuttle appears to be incoming, the higher it will be and the more time you’ll have to set up a killer smash. You may hear serious badminton players call this kind of maneuver “injection of pace.” All this means is that you add a boost of speed so you have more time to react. 2. Assume a surefooted stance. If the shuttle comes in hot, you might not have a lot of time to react. In ideal conditions, both of your feet will be pointing to the side of the court. Your feet should be about shoulder width apart, your knees slightly bent, and your eyes tracking the ball. Balance is more important at this point than winding up for your smash. If you’re not well-balanced, it’ll negatively impact your smash. 3. Raise your arms and prepare to strike. Hold your racket upright and as far back as possible while still being comfortable. The arm of your non-racket hand should be bent at the elbow and the hand should be at about chin level. The fingers of your non-racket hand can be positioned however you like. Curling your fingers into a fist is most popular, but you can leave them spread out, too. As you prepare to strike, imagine the angle the shuttle will travel. It should be as steep downward as possible while still making it over the net. Raising your non-racket hand will act as a counterbalance for your racket hand, providing greater stability for your smash. 4. Strike the shuttlecock. Aim to connect with the shuttle at the highest point possible. Inhale deeply before you swing and stretch out your non-racket arm so it's roughly shoulder level. Swing with your full racket-arm and exhale as you do so. As you swing, your racket foot should shuffle forward. Power is important at this point, but even more important is hitting the shuttle with the center of the racket. When you feel the racket come in contact with the shuttle, snap your wrist downward. This will add power and steepness to the stroke. You can increase the power of your smash by contracting your abs at the same time you swing at the shuttle. 5. Follow through with your swing and recover for the next rally. An overhead smash will be much more difficult for your opponent(s) to return. But in the event they manage to get it back over the net, you’ll need to be ready to send it right back.",

    "generated_text": "Here are the **text steps** (separate from the image):\n\n1. Grip\n   Use a relaxed forehand “handshake” grip (not panhandle). V-shape between thumb and index sits on the bevel. Keep fingers loose so you can tighten at impact.\n\n2. Ready stance + split step\n   Face the net, feet wider than shoulders, knees bent, racket up. As your opponent hits, make a light split step to react.\n\n3. Move back & turn sideways\n   Chassé or scissor-step to the rear court. Turn your body so your non-racket shoulder points toward the net.\n\n4. Load the swing\n   Non-racket arm points up at the shuttle for balance. Elbow high, racket head drops behind you; chest and hips coil.\n\n5. Set your feet\n   Rear foot behind, front foot slightly open. If possible, prepare a scissor jump (rear→front) to transfer weight forward.\n\n6. Start the swing from the body\n   Uncoil hips and shoulders first, then the elbow comes forward. Keep wrist relaxed—don’t “push” with a straight arm.\n\n7. Contact point\n   Reach fully and strike the shuttle **slightly in front** of your body at your highest comfortable point.\n\n8. Pronation & snap\n   At contact, rotate the forearm (pronation) and whip the wrist. Think “throwing” the racket head through the shuttle.\n\n9. Follow-through\n   Let the racket continue across your body naturally; don’t stop it short. This preserves power and protects your shoulder.\n\n10. Land & recover\n    Land in a scissor (rear foot forward), take a small hop, and return to base ready for the next shot.\n\nQuick tips\n\n* Aim steep and fast rather than only flat and hard.\n* Mix in drop shots and clears so opponents can’t camp on your smash.\n* Common mistakes: panhandle grip, contacting too far back, swinging only with the arm, and failing to recover.\n\nIf you’d like, I can also provide a short practice plan (shadow swings → multi-shuttle → target cones) to help you master it.\n",

    "reference_text": "1. Start small and work your way up the dumbbell scale as you progress. If you are new to doing curls, or simply looking to maintain existing muscle tone, even 1 to 3 lb (0.45 to 1.36 kg) weights may be sufficient. Taking on too much weight causes a breakdown in technique and can easily lead to injuries of the elbow, wrist, or muscle tissue. If you are going to do 2-handed curls with a bar, the same principle holds. Start at a lower weight and work your way up slowly. Everyone is different, so start with lighter weights and find the maximum amount that permits you to do your desired number of repetitions (reps) while retaining the proper form. 2. Adjust your regime to suit your goal. Generally speaking, if you are seeking to maintain existing muscle tone and arm strength, it is better to do more reps per set with a lower dumbbell weight. If you are looking to build muscle, do fewer reps at a higher weight (but again, don’t sacrifice technique). For muscle maintenance, do 1 to 3 sets of 10 to 12 reps each, for each arm. For strength building, sets of 6 to 8 reps may be preferable. Let your body be your guide. If you can’t do the number of reps you seek, reduce the dumbbell weight. If necessary, start with 1 set per arm and build up to 3. Reader Poll: We asked 649 wikiHow readers what type of exercise they enjoy most for arm workouts, and 72% of them said weightlifting. 3. Isolate your body movement so that only the arm doing the curl is moving. Traditional biceps curls are done while standing, but can also be done easily and properly while seated. Creating a solid base with your body positioning is critical to achieving this goal. Stand with your feet at hip width and your knees slightly bent. Keep your back straight and your abdomen pulled in (but not uncomfortably so). Let your arms rest at your sides and look forward—into a mirror, if possible, to monitor your technique. Sit with your feet firmly on the ground, your back straight and abdomen in, your arms to the side, and your head looking forward. Make sure the chair or bench will not impede your arm motion (or the dumbbell’s) during the curls. 4. Keep it smooth and simple. In spite of the form displayed by the aspiring Mr. Universe you might run into at the gym, a bicep curl shouldn’t be a quick, jerking motion that involves the entire body. It is meant to be a slow, steady, consistent motion that isolates a single muscle group. You can do dumbbell curls with both arms at the same time (or alternating arms), but for simplicity’s sake (especially as a beginner), you should probably start with 1 arm at a time. Or, you can do curls with both arms at the same time by using a bar. If so, you will use the same arm motions as described below for a dumbbell. With the dumbbell securely in your hand, palm facing forward and arm loose to your side, exhale and slowly bend your elbow and contract your biceps to draw the weight upward. While lifting, try to keep every other part of your body still. Keep raising the weight until it is at shoulder height, or even touching your shoulder. Pause for a beat without stopping to let the weight rest on your shoulder. Inhale and slowly lower the weight back to the starting position. Don’t let it just drop back down — control the movement in each direction. 5. Don’t cheat yourself. Sacrificing form to lift bigger dumbbells not only risks injury, it also minimizes the benefits of the curls. “Maxing out” on a curl should mean getting the most out of each one, not hurting yourself by flailing around with a giant dumbbell. Keep your wrists straight and rigid throughout the entire curl. It is easy to cause injury by using your wrist as a lever or letting it swing loosely. Use wrist wraps if they help. [9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Don’t lean forward to start the curl, and/or rock backward during the lift. Your body should not be acting as a pendulum during the curl — this takes the focus away from your biceps, and can cause a loss of balance and possible injury. Don’t let the weight rest on your shoulder at the top of the motion. If you need a break during a set, you are using too much weight or doing too many reps. Likewise, don’t rest your elbows on your hips or the sides of your abdomen during the motion. You want the full weight of the dumbbells to be isolated on your biceps. 6. Return and repeat. When you finish a curl, make sure you extend your arm fully — leaving your elbow slightly bent is another cheat that will reduce the impact of each curl. Once you’ve returned the dumbbell to the proper starting position, pause just long enough to refocus and exhale as you begin the next lift. Rest for 30 to 90 seconds between sets, if you are doing more than 1. If you're curling 1 arm at a time, keep alternating arms while allowing 1 to rest between its sets. Again, it is better to reduce the weight, or your reps or sets, than to let your form break down.",

    "reference_text": "1. Lie on your right side on a yoga mat. You’ll be putting your weight on your feet and your elbow, so you’ll want something soft beneath you. Spread out so you’re lying on your right side on the floor. If you don’t have a yoga mat, try to do this exercise on carpet or a rug so you have a little bit of cushion beneath you. 2. Put your left foot on top of your right foot. Stick your legs straight out so they’re in line with your glutes, then stack your feet on top of each other. This will help you keep your body straight, so it’s super important! Your feet will be anchoring you to the ground, so it’s really important they stay steady throughout this exercise. 3. Push your right elbow underneath your right armpit. Spread your palm out wide to keep your balance. Your arm will be taking most of your weight, so really dig it into the floor to keep your balance. Make sure your right arm stays at a 90-degree angle from your torso the entire time. 4. Engage your core to lift your hips off the ground. To get into the plank position, squeeze your abs and your glutes tight. Lift your hips up off the ground until your body creates a slanted line from your head down to your feet. If you’re having trouble keeping your balance, place your left hand on your hip. Otherwise, keep it flat along your left side. Keep your hips in a straight line with the rest of your body—don't lift them up or let them sink down. [5] X Expert Source Laila Ajani Fitness Trainer Expert Interview 5. Hold the pose for 6 seconds, then lower your hips. When you’re first starting out, this pose might be tough to hold. Try to go for at least 6 seconds, then slowly lower your hips back to the floor. As you get better, you can try holding your side plank for up to 30 seconds at a time. If you’re having trouble, try exhaling as you lift your hips up and inhaling as you lower down. This will help you engage the right muscles so you can hold the pose for longer. 6. Repeat that 3 to 5 times, then switch to your left side. As you practice this more, you’ll be able to do more reps. When you first start out, try to do the pose 3 to 5 times, then roll over onto your left side and repeat. If you don’t feel exhausted by these reps, you can try doing a few more. On the left side, your left arm and left foot will be underneath your body. 7. Bend your knees if you’re a beginner. If you find the normal side plank to be a little too tough, get into a side plank position, but bend your knees to stick your feet out behind you. Engage your glutes to lift your hips off the floor, and use your knees instead of your feet to keep your balance. [9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source This is a good way to practice the side plank if you’re having trouble keeping your back straight. 8. Do leg raises to engage your obliques. Get into a normal side plank position. Keeping your spine straight, lift your top leg up toward the ceiling, taking it a little bit higher than hip height. Quickly lower your leg back down to complete one repetition. If you’re having trouble keeping your balance, place your outside hand on your hip to keep yourself steady. To really challenge yourself, try holding a dumbbell in your upper hand as you do your leg lifts. Try doing leg lifts 10 to 15 times on each side. 9. Try hip dips to strengthen your lower obliques. Get into a side plank position, then place your left hand on your hip. Slowly lower your hips down toward the floor, stopping just before they touch the ground. Quickly engage your abs to lift your hips back up again for one repetition. You’ll feel this in your abs, your glutes, and your obliques. It’s important to raise back up into a classic side plank position with your spine straight. That way, you won’t lose your posture throughout the exercise. If you’re having trouble with this exercise, do a side plank on your knees and try hip dips that way. Try doing hip dips for 15 to 30 seconds on each side. 10. Do a side plank crunch to work on your abs. Get into a side plank position and lift your hips up off the ground. Pull your upper leg and upper arm in towards your torso to do a crunch on that side of your body. Extend your arm and leg outwards to get out of the crunch and complete one repetition. If you feel yourself starting to rock back and forth, engage your glutes to hold yourself steady. Picture this like you’re doing a classic crunch, except now you’re on your side. Start out by doing crunches for 15 to 30 seconds on each side. 11. Work on your balance with an oblique twist. Lie on your side in a side plank position. Lift your hips off the ground, then put your outer hand up by your ear. Slowly turn in toward the floor, stopping yourself when you’re looking directly at your lower forearm. Twist back around to get into your side plank position. These twists engage your entire body, so they’re a great overall workout. Twist 10 to 15 times on each side. 12. Try a side plank slide to challenge yourself. Get into a side plank position. Slowly slide your feet outwards, keeping your spine straight and your weight on your elbow. Tilt your arm so it’s at an angle to work your obliques, then hold the pose for a few seconds. Engage your obliques to slide back upwards into a normal side plank. This move can be a little tough on your elbow, so put a pillow or a foam mat underneath your arm if you need to. Try to keep your spine straight the entire time to get the most out of this workout. Work up to doing slides for 15 to 30 seconds on each side.",

Because the rays are nearly parallel, the parabolic surface reflects them so they **converge toward a common focus**. This creates a **real, inverted image** at the **focal plane**.\n\n2. **Fold/redirect the beam**\n   To reach a convenient viewing or instrument position, a **secondary mirror** intercepts the converging beam and redirects it:\n\n   * **Newtonian**: a small **flat** mirror at ~45° sends the light out the side of the tube to a focuser.\n   * **Cassegrain**: a small **convex** mirror sends the light back through a hole in the primary to the rear of the telescope.\n\n3. **Viewing or recording the image**\n\n   * An **eyepiece** acts like a magnifying glass that views the real image at the focal plane, producing a magnified virtual image for your eye.\n   * A **camera sensor** can be placed at the focal plane to record the image directly (prime focus).\n\n4. **Key relationships**\n\n   * **Magnification** (for visual use): ( M \\approx \\dfrac{f_{\\text{telescope}}}{f_{\\text{eyepiece}}} ).\n   * **Angular resolution (diffraction limit)**: ( \\theta \\approx 1.22,\\dfrac{\\lambda}{D} ), so a **larger aperture (D)** resolves finer detail.\n   * **Light-gathering power** scales with **area** (\\propto D^2), so bigger mirrors reveal fainter objects.\n\n5. **Practical notes**\n\n   * The central obstruction (secondary mirror) and its support can slightly reduce contrast and create diffraction spikes on bright stars.\n   * Reflectors avoid chromatic aberration (since mirrors reflect all wavelengths the same), but they must be **collimated** (optics precisely aligned) to perform at their best.\n   * Image orientation isn’t “upright”—it may appear **rotated and/or mirrored** depending on the design and accessories, which is fine for astronomy.\n\nIf you’d like, I can also generate a second image showing the Cassegrain light path or label additional components (spider vanes, focuser, focal plane detail, etc.).\n",

    "reference_text": "The diagram shows the different components that make up the heart. The heart is the key organ in the circulatory system. As a hollow, muscular pump, its main function is to propel blood throughout the body. The septum is the wall of muscle divides it down the middle, into a left half and a right half. There are 4 chambers in the heart: top chamber is called atrium; bottom chambers are called ventricles. Blood can flow from the atrium to ventricle because of openings called valves. Valves open in one direction like trapdoors to let the blood pass through, then they close, so the blood cannot flow backwards into the atria. There are also valves at the bottom of the large arteries that carry blood away from the heart: the aorta and the pulmonary artery. These valves keep the blood from flowing backward into the heart once it has been pumped out. Blood vessels of the body carry blood in a circle: moving away from the heart in arteries, traveling to various parts of the body in capillaries, and going back to the heart in veins. All the blood from the body is eventually collected into the two largest veins: the superior vena cava, which receives blood from the upper body, and the inferior vena cava, which receives blood from the lower body region.",
