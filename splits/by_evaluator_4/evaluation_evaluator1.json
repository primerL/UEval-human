    "reference_text": "1. 1. Start with two tall hill shapes. Add a curve underneath each shape, then draw ovals inside each shape with a circle cut out of the ovals. 2. 2. Draw a curve above each eye with an oval in the middle. 3. 3. Add a line underneath the nose, then sketch a hook shape on either side. 4. 4. Draw a curve underneath the cartoon puppy face's mouth. 5. 5. Sketch a curve on either side of the face. 6. 6. Draw a rectangle with rounded edges to outline the head. 7. 7. Outline an oval for the right ear. Make sure the oval is behind the face. 8. 8. Repeat the previous step for the left ear. 9. 9. Use a wavy shape to draw a patch around your puppy face's eye. Finally, outline your easy dog face with black. Use thick lines for most of the drawing and a thin line for the patch. If you like, add a dog biscuit to give your dog a treat. 10. You can fill in your easy dog face with any color, but this guide recommends using tan for the face and dark brown for the ears, nose and patch. Leave the eyes white, and add a white highlight to the nose.",

Clean outline\n   Trace the circle cleanly (keep guidelines faint so you can erase them later).\n\n3. Eyes\n   Place two big oval eyes on the horizontal guideline, spaced about one eye-width apart. Add tiny highlights (white dots) to make them lively.\n\n4. Nose & muzzle\n   Under the eye line, draw a small upside-down triangle nose. From the sides of the nose, curve two lines down and around to form a soft “W” for the cheeks and a small smile. Add a little tongue if you like.\n\n5. Ears\n   Add two floppy, rounded triangle ears attached near the top sides of the head.\n\n6. Details\n   Add short eyebrow curves above the eyes, a small chin line, and three tiny whisker dots on each cheek (optional).\n\n7. Refine the smile\n   Thicken the mouth line slightly and round the cheeks so it looks friendly. Erase the guidelines.\n\n8. Finish\n   Add a collar and tag under the chin if desired. You can also add a patch around one eye or a few spots. Ink your final lines and color if you want.\n\nTips:\n\n* Keep everything round and soft for a cute look.\n* If you want a different breed vibe, change the ear shape (pointy for a husky, long and thin for a hound).\n* Eyes higher = younger/cuter; eyes lower = older/goofier.\n\nIf you want, I can also make a printable worksheet version.\n",

Outline the triangular shape of the eye using curved lines, then shade the round pupil inside. Detail the skin above and below the eye with curved lines. 2. 2. Use overlapping curved lines to sketch the trunk, mouth, and jaw. Notice the tusk overlapping the trunk. To draw the tusk, extend a curved line from just in front of the mouth and double it back upon itself. 3. 3. Complete the trunk using a long curved line. Note the “C” shape of the prehensile tip of the trunk. Then, enclose the ear using a long curved line. 4. 4. Enclose the remaining ear and trunk, using a curved line for each. Detail the ears with curved lines, and use another curved line to begin sketching the elephant’s chest. 5. 5. Draw the foreleg. Use a pair of roughly parallel curved lines that form a loose zigzag shape. Connect them at the bottom with a curved line. Use “U” shaped lines to indicate the toenails. 6. 6. Draw the rear leg. Again, use a pair of curved lines and connect them at the bottom. Detail the toes with “U” shaped lines. Connect the tops of each leg with a curved line, forming the belly. 7. 7. Draw the remaining foreleg. Use curved lines and connect them at the bottom. Then, extend a long curved line from the ear to the top of the rear leg to enclose the body. Detail the shoulder and hip with curved lines. 8. 8. Use a curved line to enclose the remaining rear leg, partially hidden behind the first. Draw the toenails on both the front and rear legs. Extend two curved lines from the back of the body and allow them to meet at a point, forming the tail. 9. 9. Use curved lines that meet at jagged points to enclose a tuft of hair at the tip. 10. Color your cartoon elephant. Elephants are usually brown or grey.",

From the center of the face, curve an “S” line outward for the trunk path. Add a light vertical guideline down the head and a horizontal one for eye placement.\n\n3. Block in features\n   Loosely outline the head, following the circle. Shape the trunk along your guide with a rounded tip. Mark a tiny smile line and two small ovals for cheeks.\n\n4. Define the ears\n   Trace clean, thick, rounded outlines over the ear guides. Add a second inner line to suggest the inner ear.\n\n5. Body & legs\n   Neck: a short curve from head to body. Draw two front leg stubs, then a back leg peeking from behind. Add a curved belly line.\n\n6. Details\n   Add two big oval eyes with small highlights, a tiny tail curl, and short toe splits. Optional: tiny tusks peeking beside the trunk.\n\n7. Clean-up\n   Erase construction lines. Smooth any wobbly edges so the silhouette reads clearly.\n\n8. Finish\n   Flat color: soft gray body, pink inner ears/cheeks; black eyes. Add the lightest ground shadow under the feet.\n\nQuick tips\n• Keep the head larger than the body for cuteness.\n• Place eyes low on the head and spaced widely.\n• Trunk overlaps the cheek—use that overlap to show depth.\n• If it looks stiff, slightly tilt the head and vary ear sizes a touch.\n\nIf you want any changes to the style (cuter/chibi, more realistic, side view, etc.), tell me and I’ll regenerate a new visual step sheet to match!\n",

They should meet in a gentle curve on the top end, but they should not connect on the bottom end. This outlines the body, or fuselage, of the rocket. 3. 3. Enclose the open end of the rocket using a pair of straight lines. 4. 4. Band the nose cone with two pairs of curved parallel lines. 5. 5. Draw portholes, or small windows, along the side of the rocket. To do so, draw several circles of different sizes. 6. 6. Draw the rocket's fin. First, draw a straight line from the tail of the rocket to its middle. Then, draw curved lines downward from each end of the straight line. Allow the curved lines to meet at a gentle point. 7. 7. Erase guide lines from the fin. 8. 8. Draw the rocket's second fin. To do so, extend two curved lines from the top side of the rocket - one emerging from the middle of the ship, the other from its base. Allow the lines to meet at a gentle point. 9. 9. Draw the flames, called exhaust, coming from the rocket's nozzle, or base. Use a series of short curved lines that meet in jagged points to draw a rounded triangular shape. Then, use another series of lines to draw a second layer. Finally, draw the third layer of the exhaust, allowing it to end at a point. 10. Color your rocket. Rockets such as the one in this drawing guide were popular illustrations during the 1950s and 1960s. Some were silver in color, while others had bright red, blue, or other colored markings.",

    "question": "How to hand-wash delicate clothing safely? Provide a visual guide and text the steps. ",
    "reference_text": "1. The tags on your clothes tell you the best ways to clean them. Read through the tag on each garment that you’re washing to see what fabric it’s made from and how to clean it properly. Keep similar fabrics together so you can wash them at the same time. Anything that can go in your machine or that has a “hand wash only” label is safe for hand-washing. If a tag says “dry clean only,” then avoid hand-washing that garment to avoid damaging it. As a quick way to check if your garments are safe to hand-wash, place a drop of water on the fabric and blot it up with a paper towel. If the color runs or bleeds, then take it to the dry cleaners. 2. Washing similar garments in the same load prevents colors from running. Sort your laundry so all the light fabrics are separated from the dark ones. Since darker colors could potentially discolor the water, wash the lightest colored clothes first and save the darker ones for last. If you have a new item of clothing that is dyed or colored, wash it separately in a different tub or basin so the color does not get on other clothing. 3. Using a stain remover beforehand makes it easier to wash out. Apply the stain remover directly over the mark on your clothes. Gently dab the stain with your fingers or brush it lightly with a new toothbrush to work the cleaner deeper into the fabric. Let the stain remover sit for about 10–15 minutes before you wash your garment. Test the stain remover in a small inconspicuous spot on your clothes before applying it directly to the stain. 4. A mild detergent meant for delicates cleans clothes more gently. Use your bathtub, sink, or large bowl depending on how many clothes you need to wash. Stick with cool or lukewarm water when you wash your clothes to prevent colors from running. Mix about 1 1 ⁄ 2 fluid ounces (44 ml) of detergent into the water until it’s completely dissolved and forms suds. [5] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Wool and fine knits: Use cold water and wool detergent to keep the fabric soft. Silk or lace: Try a no-rinse detergent to limit how much water comes in contact with the fabric. Alternatively, use mild liquid dish soap if you’re in a pinch. 5. Gently stirring the water is less damaging to clothes than scrubbing. Drop your first load of clothes into the water so they’re submerged. Then, use your hands to gently move the clothes around to wash out the dirt between the fibers. Keep agitating the water for about 2–3 minutes, or until the clothes look clean. Sweaters: Turn sweaters inside-out before washing them to clean them better. Avoid scrubbing, twisting, or rubbing your clothes together when you hand-wash them since you could stretch and damage the fabric. 6. Soaking helps lift dirt and stains deep in the fabric. Leave your clothes submerged for at least 10 minutes so the detergent has time to work through the fabric. If your clothes are really dirty or have stubborn stains, leave them in the water for up to 30 minutes so it’s even more effective. It’s normal for the water to darken as dirt lifts out of the fabric. If the water ever looks really cloudy or dirty, empty it out and refill your container. 7. A thorough rinse removes all the detergent and leftover dirt. Either empty out your container and refill it with clean water, or hold your garments underneath a running faucet. Gently squeeze your clothes as you rinse them until you don’t see any more suds coming out. Alternatively, fill a second container with clean water and transfer your clothes over to rinse them. 8. Gently squeezing your clothes prevents them from stretching. Hold your garments above the water when you squeeze them so you don’t drip. then, lay your garment flat on a towel and slowly roll the towel up to squeeze out even more water. Avoid twisting or wringing out your clothes too forcefully since you’ll stretch or damage the fabric fibers. 9. Drying your clothes flat helps them preserve their shape. While T-shirts and pants are safe to hang dry, delicate fabrics could stretch or distort. When you’re washing sweaters, silks, bras, or lingerie, spread the garments flat so they’re shaped correctly. Keep them in a well-ventilated spot and flip your clothes over after 1–2 hours so the other side can dry. Turn a fan on in the same room as your clothes to help them dry faster. Avoid putting your clothes in the dryer unless the care tag says it’s safe. Otherwise, your clothes may get damaged or shrink.",

    "question": "How to Exfoliate Your Body for Soft Skin? Provide a visual guide and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Have a bath or shower. While not part of the exfoliating process per se, immersing your body in hot water will open up your pores, making your skin much more susceptible to cleaning. It also helps to do this process in the bathroom, as you'll need a ready supply of hot water and somewhere to wash away the dead skin flakes once they've been scrubbed off. Use a skin-friendly, perfume-free detergent for bath and allow at least 15 minutes to soften (macerating) the skin surface. It is good when the skin surface looks a bit \"deformed\". Remove \"dead skin\" by rubbing it away with your hands. It will work well, especially at your feet, toes and heels. 2. Get a textured sponge to wash your skin. Tending to your skin with it will help rub away excess skin flakes, leaving your skin softer and cleaner than before. It is recommended you have a sponge ready for use once you have finished up your shower. It should feel slightly rough on your skin, but if it's abrasive to the point of pain, exfoliating wash cloths are a suitable, gentler alternative. Exfoliating can also be done with a rough washcloth. A natural bristle brush makes for a good alternative, particularly while scrubbing the backs of arms or legs. If you're the do-it-yourself type, you might look into making your own loofah from home. 3. Scrub your body gently with your sponge starting from the ankles upward. Scrub the sponge over your skin in small, circular motions. Make sure to apply some pressure to feel the sponge's rough texture on your skin; that way, it will rub the surface-layer dead skin away. Starting at the ankles is recommended because it helps to encourage positive blood circulation during the exfoliation process. healthglamour.com/how-to-exfoliate-the-body/ If you're exfoliating your entire body, make sure to give extra attention to your heels, elbows, and knees. These are generally considered to be the driest parts of one's skin, and should be given greater attention accordingly. 4. Add wet sand or salt to your full body exfoliation. If you've ever walked along the beach barefoot, you may have noticed your foot callouses soften. Sand granules are a naturally occurring exfoliant, and their grainy texture is well-suited to scraping away your excess skin flakes. Salt scrubs do the same thing. You can find sand and salt exfoliating products at any store that sells beauty and skincare products. Be forewarned: Using sand in the bath can cause a bigger mess than more common exfoliants. Although it is recommended to try it out at least once, it may not be the best course of action if you don't have the added time in your routine available to do a bit of cleaning up afterwards. Getting sand down a drain could completely ruin the plumbing pipes if done often. If using sand, it should be cleaned, even bleached, because getting it from outdoors could introduce bacteria and using that to exfoliate would do more harm than good. Choose sand with small granules, not big, because the smaller granules are more gentle on the skin. Focus on the tougher skin of the arms and legs because sand can be more intense than exfoliating scrubs. 5. Rinse with hot water. Closing up shop with a body rinse is a relaxing and effective way to finish your exfoliation. Although it's recommended you repeat this process at least three times a week, you should notice an immediate softness with your skin. Applying a moisturizer or shea butter following your rinse, even following an otherwise purely 'mechanical' cleanse, will help your skin better retain moisture.",

Skip if skin is inflamed.\n* **Chemical (acids/actives):**\n\n  * **AHAs** (lactic, glycolic): dry/dull or uneven texture.\n  * **BHA** (salicylic): body breakouts, clogged pores, ingrowns.\n  * **PHA** (gluconolactone, lactobionic): very sensitive skin.\n  * **Urea** (10–20%): rough bumps/keratosis pilaris (KP).\n\n## 2) Step-by-step routine (shower days)\n\n1. **Soak** in warm (not hot) water for 5–10 min.\n2. **Cleanse** with a gentle, non-stripping body wash.\n3. **Exfoliate**\n\n   * *Physical:* massage with light pressure in small circles for 30–60 sec per area; avoid chest/neck if sensitive.\n   * *Chemical:* apply a thin layer per label. Rinse-off: 1–3 min. Leave-on lotions: use a light, even coat—don’t scrub.\n4. **Rinse & pat dry** (don’t rub).\n5. **Moisturize within 3 minutes.** Look for glycerin, hyaluronic acid, ceramides; for very dry skin, seal with a light oil/occlusive.\n6. **Daytime SPF 30+** on exposed areas (AHAs/BHAs increase sun sensitivity).\n\n## 3) How often?\n\n* **Sensitive:** 1×/week (soft cloth or PHA).\n* **Normal/combination:** 1–2×/week.\n* **Dry/KP-prone:** 2–3×/week (lactic acid or urea, avoid gritty scrubs).\n* **Oily/acne-prone:** 2–3×/week BHA on problem zones (back, chest).\n\n> Signs you’re overdoing it: stinging that lasts, tightness, shiny but fragile skin, more redness or breakouts. Cut back to once weekly.\n\n## 4) Do’s & don’ts\n\n**Do**\n\n* Use gentle pressure; let products do the work.\n* Rinse mitts/cloths after each use; wash weekly; replace loofahs monthly.\n* Exfoliate **before** shaving (same session is OK for gentle physical or mild rinse-off acids).\n* Moisturize every time.\n\n**Don’t**\n\n* Exfoliate on sunburn, open cuts, or active eczema/psoriasis flares.\n* Mix strong actives on the same day (e.g., retinoids + strong acids).\n* Exfoliate right after waxing/laser; wait **48–72 hours**.\n* Use very hot water.\n\n## 5) Targeted tips\n\n* **Ingrown hairs/razor bumps:** Use BHA 0.5–2% the day **before** shaving and again 24–48 h after; shave with slip (gel/cream) in hair-growth direction.\n* **Keratosis pilaris:** Daily urea 10–20% or lactic acid 5–12% lotion; brief gentle physical buffing 2–3×/week; be patient (4–6 weeks).\n* **Feet/elbows/knees:** Can tolerate slightly stronger scrubs—keep separate tools for feet.\n\n## 6) Simple weekly template\n\n* **Mon:** BHA on back/chest after shower → moisturize.\n* **Wed:** Gentle washcloth buff head-to-toe → moisturize.\n* **Fri:** Lactic-acid or urea body lotion (leave-on) at night.\n* **Sun (optional):** Spot-treat rough patches only.\n\n*Friendly reminder:* If you’re pregnant/nursing or on prescription topicals, check product safety first.

    "question": "How to clean a cutting board? Provide steps with visuals and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Rinse your board right after using it. Rinse your board with water right after you use it, rather than waiting until the end of the meal or even the next day when you clean it. This will help minimize bacteria growth and keep your board cleaner. Resist the urge to throw your board in the sink after the meal and forget about it. 2. Clean your board with dish soap and hot water. To clean your cutting board, scrub it with a few drops of dish soap on a sponge and some hot water. [2] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview Be sure to remove any food particles as you wash, paying particular attention to any grooves or scrapes in your board. Food can collect in these spots. Never clean a wooden cutting board in the dishwasher or soak it in water. The wood will absorb water, which can lead to bacteria and mold forming. [4] X Expert Source James Sears House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview 3. Rinse your board. Rinse your board to remove any traces of soap. You don’t want whatever you cook next to taste like your dish soap. [5] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview 4. Dry your board thoroughly to prevent cracking. After you’re finished washing your cutting board, dry it thoroughly with a clean dishtowel, removing any excess water. This is particularly important if your board is made of wood, as they are more prone to cracks. 5. Use a combination of white vinegar and baking soda. To sanitize your cutting board after use, sprinkle it with some baking soda. Then, spray the baking soda–covered board with white vinegar. This will fizz, helping draw stains out of your board and deodorizing it. Let this mix sit for 5 minutes and then rinse your board with water, drying as normal. 6. Disinfect your board with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Just as hydrogen peroxide can clean a wound, it can also clean your cutting board. Sprinkle your board with 3% hydrogen peroxide solution, and let it stand for 1 minute to kill any surface bacteria. Then, rinse your board with water, and dry with a dishtowel as normal. [8] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview Hydrogen peroxide can bleach porous surfaces like wood. Don’t let the solution sit too long or it might fade your cutting board. 7. Remove stains with a scrub of coarse salt. For deep, set-in stains on your cutting board, use a coarse salt, such as kosher salt, as a scrub. [10] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview Wet a sponge and use a handful of salt to scour your board, focusing on any areas of discoloration. Rinse your board with water when finished, and dry with a clean towel. [11] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview Be sure to wash your hands well and moisturize them with lotion after scrubbing your board with salt. It can be very drying. Another option is wearing kitchen gloves. 8. Wash your board with diluted bleach once a month. Especially if you work with raw meats and fish on your cutting board, use a diluted bleach solution to do a deep clean of your board once a month. Make a solution that’s 1/8th bleach and 7/8ths water. Wet a sponge, and scrub your board with the solution. Rinse well with plain water and dry your board as normal with a clean towel. 9. Rub your board with a lemon to deodorize once a week. To keep your board smelling fresh, use half of a cut lemon to deodorize your board. Rub the cut-side of the lemon along the length of the board side to side. Then, rinse with plain water, and dry with a clean towel. 10. Condition your cutting board weekly. If your cutting board is made of wood, use mineral oil to condition your board after it’s clean. This will keep it in optimal condition. Do not use organic oils or fats, which can turn rancid, to lubricate your board. Look for products labeled kitchen-grade white mineral oil, such as Howard’s Cutting Board Oil. There are other mineral oils meant for lubricating machinery but not for consumption. Look specifically for kitchen-grade oil. You can condition your board every time you clean it, or a minimum of once a week. Simply rub your board with the conditioner, and let it air try so the oil can soak in.",

    "generated_text": "# How to Slice a Pineapple (text guide)\n\n**You’ll need:** ripe pineapple, large chef’s knife, sturdy cutting board, optional paring knife or small round cutter, towel.\n\n1. **Prep & safety**\n\n* Rinse the pineapple. Place a damp towel under the board so it won’t slip.\n\n2. **Remove crown & base**\n\n* Lay the pineapple on its side. Slice off about ½ inch from the top (crown) and bottom to make flat ends.\n\n3. **Stand and peel**\n\n* Stand it upright. Following the curve of the fruit, slice downward in long strips to remove the skin. Keep cuts shallow to save fruit.\n\n4. **Remove the “eyes”**\n\n* You’ll see brown “eyes” left in diagonal rows. Make shallow V-shaped notches along those diagonals (or shave them off) until the flesh is clean.\n\n5. **Choose your cut**\n\n* **Method A — Rings:** Lay the pineapple on its side and slice crosswise into ½-inch discs. Use a small round cutter or a paring knife to remove the hard core circle from each disc.\n* **Method B — Spears & Chunks:** Stand it up. Cut in half lengthwise, then into quarters. Lay each quarter flat and slice off the tough core (a pale, fibrous triangle) from the center edge. Cut quarters into long spears, then into bite-size chunks.\n\n6. **Serve or store**\n\n* Eat right away, or refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 3–4 days. For longer storage, freeze chunks on a tray, then bag.\n\n**Tips**\n\n* A ripe pineapple smells sweet at the base and yields slightly when pressed.\n* For cleaner cuts, wipe juice from the board as you go.\n* Try a sprinkle of lime and chili powder, or grill spears 1–2 minutes per side for caramelization.\n\n(Visual guide generated separately above.)\n",

These hotkeys are represented by two different images of a sun, one for increasing and another for decreasing brightness. Find the keys on your keyboard to get started. These hotkeys will look slightly different on every computer. They are often differentiated by a filled-in sun (decrease) and an empty sun (increase) or a sun with dots for rays (decrease) and a sun with lines for rays (increase). Also be on the lookout for arrows pointing upwards or downwards, indicating an increase or decrease in brightness. These hotkeys will be mapped onto different buttons on different keyboards. Check out your left and right arrow keys, or the function keys (F1, F2, etc.) lining the top of your keyboard. 2. Hold down the \"Fn\" key on your keyboard. The brightness hotkeys are not the primary function of the keys they are mapped onto. You'll therefore needed to hold down the Fn key while you adjust your screen's brightness. 3.

It was always accessible for maintenance and intentionally shaped to be navigable.\n* **Functional sculptures:** The helmet-like “warriors” are chimney stacks and ventilation towers; their sculptural forms also help manage wind and prevent back-drafts and rain ingress—so they’re both art and infrastructure.\n* **Structural logic below:** The varying roof levels follow the catenary-arch attic structure underneath, creating hills and dips that turn the roof into a walkable topography.\n* **Open to visitors today:** Railings, marked routes, and staffed entry make the space safely accessible as part of the La Pedrera museum experience, so visitors can explore the architecture and the city views.\n",

    "question": "How to do a squat with a Squat Rack? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Start with a low weight. The most important thing with squats is to have the correct form, so you shouldn't attempt weighted squats until you can perform body weight squats with perfect form. Start with a low weight — maybe just using the bar (which weighs 45lbs) — and slowly build yourself up to heavier weights as your squat technique and muscle strength improves. 2. Position the bar correctly. Set up the squat rack so the bar is slightly below shoulder level. Position the safety bars so they are low enough to allow you to squat down fully with the bar on your shoulders. When you're ready, duck under the bar and grip it widely with your palms facing forward. Rest the bar across your upper back (not your neck). If this feels uncomfortable for you, try using a bar pad. 3. Squat using the same technique as the body weight squat. Place your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, with your toes pointing slightly outwards. Hinge your hips and push your butt backwards until your hamstrings are parallel with the floor. Keep your chest up, your shoulders back and your eyes looking straight ahead. Remember to keep your back straight — this is especially important when you are squatting with heavy weights. Push out of the squat with your heels and don't let your knees cave in towards the center. If this happens, you may need to reduce your weight. 4. Inhale on the way down, exhale on the way back up. Breathing deeply is very important when squatting heavy weights. If you hold your breath you can become dizzy, nauseous or even blackout. Take a deep breath in as you squat down and exhale powerfully as you rise up. Maintaining this breathing pattern will give you the energy you need to keep going. If you're pushing yourself to get another few repetitions, don't be afraid to pause between repetitions to take a couple of deep breaths.",

Set J-cups & safeties → 2) Load bar & collars → 3) Unrack & walkout → 4) Stance & brace → 5) Descend → 6) Bottom position & depth → 7) Drive up → 8) Re-rack, plus a “Common mistakes” box (knees caving, heels lifting, bar drifting forward, excessive arch/round).\n\n# Text steps (detailed)\n\n1. Rack setup\n\n* Set J-cups around mid-chest so the bar is ~1–2 in (2–5 cm) below shoulder height.\n* Set safety pins just below your expected bottom depth (they should catch the bar if you fail without touching it during good reps).\n\n2. Load & secure\n\n* Load plates evenly and add collars. Clear the area behind you.\n\n3. Bar position & grip\n\n* Walk under the bar. Place it across the upper traps (high-bar) or slightly lower on the rear delts (low-bar)—choose one and keep it consistent.\n* Hands just outside shoulder width, squeeze the bar, wrists neutral (not bent back), elbows angled down/back to lock the upper back.\n\n4. Stance & bracing\n\n* Step under the bar with feet under hips, stand tall to unrack.\n* Take 1–2 controlled steps back.\n* Set feet shoulder-width (give or take), toes turned out ~10–30°.\n* Big breath into your belly and sides, brace your core 360°, ribs stacked over pelvis.\n\n5. The descent\n\n* Keep the bar over your mid-foot.\n* Break at hips and knees together; let the knees track over your toes (not collapsing inward).\n* Maintain a neutral spine and steady gaze (chin tucked, eyes forward).\n\n6. Bottom position & depth\n\n* Aim for hip crease at or just below the top of the knee (or the deepest pain-free, controlled range you can maintain).\n* Shins roughly forward, whole foot glued to the floor, weight mid-foot to heel.\n\n7. The ascent\n\n* Drive the floor away, push up through mid-foot/heels.\n* Keep knees tracking over toes and chest tall; think “stand up with the bar” and “drive hips and chest together.”\n* Exhale through the sticking point or finish the rep, then reset your breath between reps.\n\n8. Re-rack safely\n\n* Step forward until both sides touch the uprights, then sit the bar straight down into the J-cups.\n* Don’t let go until you’re sure it’s seated.\n\n9. Safety & spotting tips\n\n* Warm up with the empty bar, then small jumps.\n* Shoes with firm, flat or lifting soles improve stability.\n* Use a spotter for heavy sets (they should follow your torso and assist only if the bar stalls).\n* If you must bail alone: drop to the safeties by sitting back/soft knees and letting the bar settle on the pins—then step forward out.\n\n10. Common mistakes to avoid\n\n* Knees caving in hard.\n* Heels lifting or rocking to toes.\n* Bar drifting forward of mid-foot.\n* Over-arching or rounding the back.\n* Rushing the walkout (take only 1–2 steps).\n\n11. Simple programming starter\n\n* 3–5 sets × 3–8 reps, leaving 1–3 reps in reserve. Rest 2–4 minutes.\n\nWant a version tailored to front squats or low-bar specifics?

If you feel unstable, or like you're losing your balance, practice this method with a wall or railing near by. Place your hands on the wall or the railing. 3. Lift your heels until you're standing on your tippy toes. Distribute most of your weight onto the balls of your feet, and keep your legs straight. 4. Stay on your tippy toes for two seconds. Then, begin to lower your heels, and move your weight away from the balls of your feet. Lower your heels until they're below the step, or platform.

    "reference_text": "1. Lie down on the floor. Lie down on a fitness mat. Lie with your back flat on the ground, legs together and knees bent. Keep in mind that this movement is not recommended for anyone who has ever had a back problem. This movement can be made easier by placing your hands and arms lower on your body (crossing arms in front of your chest) or harder, by placing your hands and arms past your head (arms extended above your head). 2. Turn your legs to one side. With your knees remaining bent, turn at your waist and bring both of your legs to one side of your body, down to the floor. Your legs should be lying on top of each other. As you bring your legs down to the floor, keep your shoulder blades and the upper part of your back flat on the floor. Your rib cage should be down and not flared out in this position. If you overextend, you risk straining your upper back. [4] X Expert Source Brendon Rearick Personal Trainer & Strength Coach Expert Interview 3. Crunch to your side. Place your hands behind or at the sides of your head. Flex your abdominal muscles, and lift your shoulders off the floor. Be sure to keep your shoulders straight and level just as you would for a normal crunch. Hold the position for a moment, then release your constricted abdominal muscles to slowly bring your shoulders back down to the mat. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Do not pull at your head and neck to complete the crunch. Your hands are merely resting near your head as you contract your abdominal muscles to lift yourself up and crunch. [7] X Expert Source Brendon Rearick Personal Trainer & Strength Coach Expert Interview Exhale as you crunch and inhale as you return to your starting position. Then, repeat. Breathing properly will put your diaphragm in a better position for abdominal work. [8] X Expert Source Brendon Rearick Personal Trainer & Strength Coach Expert Interview 4. Complete your crunches on the other side of your body. Once you have completed one set of crunches on one side of your body (about 10–15 reps), turn your legs over to do the crunches on other side of your body. It’s recommended to do this exercise 1–3 sets on each side, 2–3 times a week.",

As we breathe, oxygen enters the nose or mouth and passes the sinuses, which are hollow spaces in the skull. Sinuses help regulate the temperature and humidity of the air we breathe. The trachea, also called the windpipe, filters the air that is inhaled, according to the American Lung Association. It branches into the bronchi, which are two tubes that carry air into each lung. The bronchial tubes are lined with tiny hairs called cilia. Cilia move back and forth, carrying mucus up and out. Mucus, a sticky fluid, collects dust, germs and other matter that has invaded the lungs. We expel mucus when we sneeze, cough, spit or swallow.",

This is the **mucociliary escalator**.\n\n**3) What happens to the trapped stuff.**\n\n* When the mucus reaches the throat, you **swallow** it.

The key idea is to use a Siamese network structure, where both augmented views are passed through separate encoders. The encoders produce representations of the images, which are then passed to a predictor (a small MLP) to generate predictions.\n\nThe critical component here is the \"stop-gradient\" operation applied to one of the branches, which prevents the gradients from propagating through it during backpropagation. This allows the model to learn by comparing the predictions of the two augmented views, pushing them to match without relying on negative samples.\n\nIn the training process, the model uses a loss function (usually cosine similarity) that minimizes the distance between the predictions from the two views.\n",

It’s a two-part block:\n\n1. a **gated cross-attention (XATTN)** sublayer, and\n2. a **gated feed-forward (“DENSE”/MLP)** sublayer, each wrapped with pre-LayerNorm and residual connections.\n\n---\n\n## Inputs\n\n* **Text hidden states** (H \\in \\mathbb{R^{T\\times d}}): current LM token embeddings.\n* **Visual latents** (Z \\in \\mathbb{R^{M\\times d_v}}): a fixed set of tokens produced by the Perceiver Resampler from one or more images/video frames.\n* (Learned) **gating projections** that turn each token’s state into an element-wise gate.\n\n---\n\n## Step-by-step flow\n\n### 1) Gated Cross-Attention (XATTN)\n\n* **Pre-norm:** (\\tilde H = \\mathrm{LN}(H)).\n* **Cross-attention:** queries (Q) come from (\\tilde H); keys/values (K,V) come from (Z).\n  [\n  A=\\mathrm{MHA}(\\tilde H W_Q,\\; ZW_K,\\; ZW_V)\n    ]\n* **Gate the visual update:** compute a token-wise, channel-wise gate\n  [\n  g_x=\\sigma(\\tilde H W_{gx}+b_{gx})\\in\\mathbb{R^{T\\times d}},\n    ]\n  then modulate the cross-attn output and add residually: [\n  H^{(1)}=H + g_x \\odot A.\n    ]\n  The gate lets the layer learn **how much** each token should trust vision, often starting near “closed” so initial behavior matches the base LM.\n\n### 2) Gated DENSE (position-wise MLP)\n\n* **Pre-norm:** (\\hat H=\\mathrm{LN}(H^{(1)})).\n* **MLP/Dense:** (F=\\phi(\\hat H W_1 + b_1) W_2 + b_2) (with a standard nonlinearity (\\phi), e.g., GELU).\n* **Gate the MLP update:**\n  [\n  g_d=\\sigma(\\hat H W_{gd}+b_{gd}),\\qquad\n  H_{\\text{out}}=H^{(1)} + g_d \\odot F.\n    ]\n\n---\n\n## Why the gating?\n\n* **Stability with frozen backbones:** The LM (and typically the vision encoder) can remain frozen; new parameters are in the XATTN/DENSE paths and their gates. Gating prevents overwhelming the LM with visual signals early in training and enables smooth **modality balancing**.\n* **Token-specific control:** Gates are computed **per token** and **per channel**, so some words (e.g., nouns near image mentions) can open the visual pathway more than others.\n* **Regularization by design:** With gates near zero, the block reduces to an identity map, which curbs overfitting and preserves strong language priors.\n\n---\n\n## Placement in Flamingo\n\nThese Gated XATTN-DENSE blocks are **interleaved at several points** inside the LM stack. During inference on interleaved image–text streams, each text segment can query the relevant **cached** visual latents via the XATTN, while standard self-attention continues to handle language context.\n\n---\n\n## Summary of components\n\n* **LayerNorm (pre-norm)** before each sublayer\n* **Multi-Head Cross-Attention** (Q from text, K/V from visual latents)\n* **Learned sigmoid gates** (g_x, g_d) (element-wise modulation)\n* **Position-wise MLP (“DENSE”)**\n* **Residual connections** after both sublayers\n\nIf you’d like, I can annotate the diagram with your preferred symbols (e.g., different gate shapes, head counts, or exact tensor sizes) and export it as SVG or PDF.\n",
