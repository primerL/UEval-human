    "reference_text": "This image shows the parts of the human respiratory system. Respiration involves taking in air filled with oxygen into the human body or lungs and releasing carbon dioxide from the body. Respiration involves breathing through the nose/nasal cavity. The air then travels down into the lungs through the pharynx, followed by the larynx and finally through the trachea. The lungs are located in the chest cavity or thoracic cavity along with the heart. The chest cavity are covered by ribs on the outside. The pleura lines the thoracic cavity and envelopes the lungs. The trachea is subdivided into two bronchi before it enters the lungs. The bronchi are further divided into tiny bronchioles inside the lungs. The bronchioles have a tree like structure. The lungs are separated from the abdominal cavity by the diaphragm. The diaphragm contracts while breathing in and relaxes when breathing out. The process of respiration is controlled by the respiratory centers located in the brain.",

    "generated_text": "# Text explanation (separate from the image)\n\nHere’s the path air takes in and out of your lungs, step by step:\n\n1. Inhalation (breathing in)\n\n* The diaphragm contracts and moves downward while the external intercostal muscles lift the ribs.\n* This expands the chest cavity, lowering the pressure inside the lungs below outside air pressure.\n* Air flows in through the **nose or mouth** → **pharynx** (throat) → **larynx** (voice box) → **trachea** (windpipe) → splits into **right and left bronchi** → smaller **bronchioles** → tiny air sacs called **alveoli**.\n\n2. Gas exchange in the alveoli\n\n* Each alveolus is wrapped in a web of capillaries.\n* **Oxygen (O₂)** diffuses from the air in the alveoli into the blood (where it binds to hemoglobin).\n* **Carbon dioxide (CO₂)** diffuses from the blood into the alveoli to be exhaled.\n\n3. Exhalation (breathing out)\n\n* The diaphragm relaxes and moves upward; the rib cage falls.\n* Chest volume decreases, pressure inside the lungs rises above outside air pressure.\n* Air flows out along the same path in reverse: **alveoli → bronchioles → bronchi → trachea → larynx → pharynx → nose/mouth**.\n* At rest this is mostly passive; during hard breathing, abdominal and internal intercostal muscles actively squeeze air out.\n\n4. Built-in protections & helpers\n\n* **Nasal hairs, mucus, and cilia** trap dust and pathogens and sweep them upward to be swallowed or coughed out.\n* The **epiglottis** guides food away from the airway when you swallow.\n* **C-shaped cartilage rings** in the trachea keep it open.\n\n5. Quick glossary\n\n* **Diaphragm:** dome-shaped muscle under the lungs that powers breathing.\n* **Alveoli:** tiny air sacs where gas exchange happens.\n* **Bronchi/bronchioles:** branching airways that distribute air within the lungs.\n\nIf you’d like, I can add callouts for common issues (like asthma narrowing the bronchioles) or show how exercise changes breathing mechanics.\n\n*(The labeled diagram image is provided separately above.)*\n",

Above that, lighter gases become more common (start of the **heterosphere**).\n* **Ionosphere:** Not a separate “layer” by altitude alone; it **overlaps** the mesosphere/thermosphere (\\~60–1,000 km) and is defined by ionization from solar radiation (important for auroras and radio).\n\nIf you’d like, I can add typical Celsius/°F scale values on the temperature curve or include example altitudes for planes, balloons, meteors, the ISS, and GPS satellites.\n",

Because the rays are nearly parallel, the parabolic surface reflects them so they **converge toward a common focus**. This creates a **real, inverted image** at the **focal plane**.\n\n2. **Fold/redirect the beam**\n   To reach a convenient viewing or instrument position, a **secondary mirror** intercepts the converging beam and redirects it:\n\n   * **Newtonian**: a small **flat** mirror at ~45° sends the light out the side of the tube to a focuser.\n   * **Cassegrain**: a small **convex** mirror sends the light back through a hole in the primary to the rear of the telescope.\n\n3. **Viewing or recording the image**\n\n   * An **eyepiece** acts like a magnifying glass that views the real image at the focal plane, producing a magnified virtual image for your eye.\n   * A **camera sensor** can be placed at the focal plane to record the image directly (prime focus).\n\n4. **Key relationships**\n\n   * **Magnification** (for visual use): ( M \\approx \\dfrac{f_{\\text{telescope}}}{f_{\\text{eyepiece}}} ).\n   * **Angular resolution (diffraction limit)**: ( \\theta \\approx 1.22,\\dfrac{\\lambda}{D} ), so a **larger aperture (D)** resolves finer detail.\n   * **Light-gathering power** scales with **area** (\\propto D^2), so bigger mirrors reveal fainter objects.\n\n5. **Practical notes**\n\n   * The central obstruction (secondary mirror) and its support can slightly reduce contrast and create diffraction spikes on bright stars.\n   * Reflectors avoid chromatic aberration (since mirrors reflect all wavelengths the same), but they must be **collimated** (optics precisely aligned) to perform at their best.\n   * Image orientation isn’t “upright”—it may appear **rotated and/or mirrored** depending on the design and accessories, which is fine for astronomy.\n\nIf you’d like, I can also generate a second image showing the Cassegrain light path or label additional components (spider vanes, focuser, focal plane detail, etc.).\n",

It’s not a “shared pair” (like in a covalent bond); it’s a non-directional Coulombic attraction between opposite charges.\n\n**How it forms in lithium fluoride (LiF):**\n\n1. **Start with neutral atoms**\n\n* Lithium (Li): 1s² 2s¹ → one valence electron.\n* Fluorine (F): 1s² 2s² 2p⁵ → seven valence electrons.\n\n2. **Electron transfer**\n\n* Lithium loses its single 2s valence electron:\n  Li → Li⁺ + e⁻\n* Fluorine gains that electron to complete an octet:\n  F + e⁻ → F⁻\n\n3. **Ionic attraction and crystal**\n\n* The resulting ions attract strongly: Li⁺ + F⁻ → **LiF(s)**.\n* In the solid, countless Li⁺ and F⁻ ions pack into a rock-salt lattice, where each Li⁺ is surrounded by six F⁻ (and vice versa). This **lattice energy** makes LiF very stable, hard, and high-melting.\n\n**Why it happens**\nLithium easily gives up its loosely held valence electron (low ionization of the outer electron), while fluorine strongly attracts an extra electron (high electron affinity). The large electronegativity difference drives electron transfer; the lattice’s electrostatic stabilization locks the ions into the solid.\n\n---\n\n*Image is shown above.

As a hollow, muscular pump, its main function is to propel blood throughout the body. The septum is the wall of muscle divides it down the middle, into a left half and a right half. There are 4 chambers in the heart: top chamber is called atrium; bottom chambers are called ventricles. Blood can flow from the atrium to ventricle because of openings called valves. Valves open in one direction like trapdoors to let the blood pass through, then they close, so the blood cannot flow backwards into the atria. There are also valves at the bottom of the large arteries that carry blood away from the heart: the aorta and the pulmonary artery. These valves keep the blood from flowing backward into the heart once it has been pumped out. Blood vessels of the body carry blood in a circle: moving away from the heart in arteries, traveling to various parts of the body in capillaries, and going back to the heart in veins. All the blood from the body is eventually collected into the two largest veins: the superior vena cava, which receives blood from the upper body, and the inferior vena cava, which receives blood from the lower body region.",

When tectonic forces push, pull, or shear the crust, stress builds along the fault.\n\nHow faults cause earthquakes (the stick-slip cycle):\n1.\tLocked: Rough fault surfaces “stick” due to friction while plate motion keeps stressing them.\n2.\tStrain builds: Rock around the fault elastically bends and stores energy.\n3.\tRupture: When stress exceeds frictional strength, the fault suddenly slips. The break starts at the hypocenter (focus) at depth and spreads along the fault.\n4.\tSeismic waves: Stored elastic energy radiates as P and S waves that shake the ground. The point on the surface above the focus is the epicenter.\n5.\tAftershocks: The crust adjusts to the new positions, producing smaller quakes on or near the same fault.\n\nMain fault types & the stresses that create them:\n•\tNormal fault (tension/extension): Crust is pulled apart; the hanging wall moves down.\n•\tReverse/thrust fault (compression): Crust is squeezed; the hanging wall moves up (common in subduction zones and mountain belts).\n•\tStrike-slip fault (shear): Blocks slide horizontally past each other (e.g., transform boundaries); motion can be right-lateral or left-lateral.\n\nWhy some places shake more:\nMost large earthquakes occur at plate boundaries where stress accumulates fastest: subduction zones (big thrust quakes), continental collisions (reverse faults), and major transforms (strike-slip).\n\nImage generated separately above: labeled diagram showing a fault plane, the earthquake cycle with hypocenter/epicenter and waves, plus normal/reverse/strike-slip fault insets.",

In optics, a ray is an idealized model of light, obtained by choosing a line that is perpendicular to the wave fronts of the actual light, and that points in the direction of energy flow. Rays are used to model the propagation of light through an optical system by dividing the real light field up into discrete rays that can be computationally propagated through the system by the techniques of ray tracing. All three rays should meet at the same point. The Principal Ray or Chief Ray in an optical system is the meridional ray that starts at the edge of the object and passes through the center of the aperture stop.

Because of their molecular vibration modes, they interact strongly with the wavelengths of heat the surface gives off after being warmed by sunlight.\n\n**Main greenhouse gases:**\n\n* **Water vapor (H₂O)** — most abundant, highly variable\n* **Carbon dioxide (CO₂)**\n* **Methane (CH₄)**\n* **Nitrous oxide (N₂O)**\n* **Ozone (O₃)**\n* **Halocarbons** (e.g., CFCs, HFCs) in small amounts\n\n(For contrast: **nitrogen (N₂)**, **oxygen (O₂)**, and **argon (Ar)** make up most of the air but are *not* effective greenhouse gases because they don’t absorb infrared efficiently.)\n\n# Why the greenhouse effect matters for life\n\n1. **Sunlight (shortwave)** passes through the atmosphere; some is reflected by clouds and bright surfaces like ice.\n2. **Earth’s surface absorbs** the rest and **re-emits** energy upward as **infrared (longwave)** heat.\n3. **Greenhouse gases absorb and re-emit** some of that heat in all directions, including back toward the surface.\n4. This slows the escape of heat to space and **warms the lower atmosphere and surface** until a balance is reached between incoming sunlight and outgoing infrared.\n\n**Without the natural greenhouse effect,** Earth’s average surface temperature would be about **−18 °C (0 °F)**.\n**With it,** the average is about **+15 °C (59 °F)** — warm enough for **liquid water, stable climates, and the ecosystems and agriculture** life depends on.\n\n> Note: Adding extra greenhouse gases (e.g., rising CO₂ and CH₄) **enhances** the effect, shifting the balance and driving **modern climate change**.\n\n---\n\n**Image:** A labeled infographic illustrating the steps above (Sunlight in, reflection, surface warming, infrared out, greenhouse gases re-emitting heat, and the −18 °C vs +15 °C note).",

    "generated_text": "# Image — Full Carbon Cycle\n\n*(See the generated diagram above.)*\n\n# Explanation — How carbon moves, and how plant carbon ends up in fossil fuels or the air\n\n**Big picture:** Carbon moves through two intertwined loops.\n\n* The **fast (biological) cycle** shuttles carbon among the atmosphere, living things, soils, and the upper ocean (timescales: days to centuries).\n* The **slow (geologic) cycle** locks carbon into rocks and fossil fuels and returns it via tectonics and volcanoes (millennia to millions of years).\n  Human activities overlay both, rapidly moving long-stored carbon back to the air.\n\n## 1) Atmosphere ↔ Land (plants, animals, soils)\n\n1. **Photosynthesis (atmosphere → plants):** Plants take in CO₂ and build sugars/biomass.\n2. **Respiration (plants & animals → atmosphere):** Almost everything that burns those sugars releases CO₂ back.\n3. **Herbivory & food webs:** Plant carbon moves to animals; their respiration returns CO₂.\n4. **Death & detritus (plants/animals → soils):** Litter and carcasses enter soils.\n5. **Decomposition:**\n\n   * **With oxygen (oxic):** Microbes break biomass down, releasing **CO₂**.\n   * **Low-oxygen/anaerobic (wetlands, bogs, sediments):** Microbes produce **CH₄ (methane)**, which later oxidizes in the air to CO₂.\n6. **Fire:** Wildfires rapidly convert biomass to CO₂ (and some CH₄/black carbon); regrowth can re-absorb CO₂ over years to decades.\n7. **Soil storage:** Some carbon becomes stable **soil organic matter** (humus), persisting from years to centuries unless disturbed (e.g., tillage, warming, drought).\n\n## 2) Atmosphere ↔ Ocean\n\n1. **Gas exchange:** CO₂ dissolves into and out of the **surface ocean** depending on temperature, winds, and concentration gradients.\n2. **Carbonate chemistry:** In seawater, CO₂ forms **carbonic acid ↔ bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) ↔ carbonate (CO₃²⁻)**. Most ocean carbon is stored as bicarbonate/carbonate, buffering the atmosphere.\n3. **Biological pump:** Phytoplankton photosynthesize; part of their organic matter and the **CaCO₃ shells** from calcifying organisms sink, carrying carbon to the **deep ocean**. Much is respired at depth (CO₂ stored for decades–centuries) and later **upwells** back to the surface and air.\n\n## 3) Route from plant carbon → **fossil fuels** (slow cycle)\n\nOnly a tiny fraction of plant carbon escapes decomposition and fire:\n\n1. **Rapid burial in anoxic settings:** In swamps, peatlands, deltas, or marine muds, dead plant/algal matter is buried faster than it decays. Low oxygen slows microbes.\n2. **Diagenesis & maturation (heat + pressure + time):**\n\n   * **Terrestrial plants → peat → lignite → coal.**\n   * **Marine algae/zooplankton → organic-rich muds → kerogen → oil & natural gas.**\n3. **Geologic storage:** These hydrocarbons remain trapped in rocks for millions of years unless exposed, uplifted, or extracted.\n\n## 4) Weathering, rocks, and volcanoes (slow geologic loop)\n\n1. **Silicate weathering (atmosphere → rivers → ocean):** CO₂ in rainwater forms weak acid that weathers rocks; dissolved bicarbonate flows to the ocean.\n2. **Carbonate formation:** Marine organisms and chemistry turn bicarbonate into **limestone/dolomite (CaCO₃/MgCO₃)** that gets buried as rock.\n3. **Subduction & degassing:** Tectonics carry carbonates and organic sediments into the mantle; **volcanoes** and metamorphism return CO₂ to the atmosphere.\n\n## 5) Human accelerators\n\n* **Fossil fuel extraction & combustion → atmosphere:** Moves carbon from the slow reservoir (coal/oil/gas) to the fast one as CO₂.\n* **Cement production:** Releases CO₂ when limestone is calcined.\n* **Deforestation & land-use change:** Reduces photosynthetic uptake and releases stored biomass/soil carbon.\n* **Methane leaks & agriculture:** Add CH₄, which later becomes CO₂.\n* **Permafrost thaw/peatland drainage:** Frees long-stored organic carbon as CO₂/CH₄.\n* **Ocean uptake & acidification:** Extra atmospheric CO₂ drives more dissolution, shifting seawater chemistry and affecting calcifiers.\n\n## 6) Direct answers to your two “where does plant carbon go?” questions\n\n* **Into the atmosphere:** through plant/animal **respiration**, **microbial decay** (CO₂/CH₄), **fires**, and **human burning** of biomass or extracted fossil fuels.\n* **Into fossil fuels:** when dead plant (or algal) material is **rapidly buried in oxygen-poor sediments**, then **cooked by heat and pressure** for **geologic timescales**, transforming into **coal (mainly land plants)** or **oil/gas (mainly marine algae/zooplankton)**.\n\nIf you’d like, I can tailor a simpler “student cheat-sheet” version or add typical timescales and example environments for each arrow.\n",

    "reference_text": "The diagram shows the parts of the respiratory system. The human respiratory system is a series of organs responsible for taking in oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide. As we breathe, oxygen enters the nose or mouth and passes the sinuses, which are hollow spaces in the skull. Sinuses help regulate the temperature and humidity of the air we breathe. The trachea, also called the windpipe, filters the air that is inhaled, according to the American Lung Association. It branches into the bronchi, which are two tubes that carry air into each lung. The bronchial tubes are lined with tiny hairs called cilia. Cilia move back and forth, carrying mucus up and out. Mucus, a sticky fluid, collects dust, germs and other matter that has invaded the lungs. We expel mucus when we sneeze, cough, spit or swallow.",

Light from the **illuminator** is focused through the specimen by the **condenser**. The **objective** forms a **real, inverted intermediate image** inside the tube; the **eyepiece** then magnifies that into the **virtual image** you see.\n\n**Total magnification = (eyepiece power) × (objective power).**\n**Resolution** (smallest detail you can separate) improves with higher **NA** of the objective/condenser and with shorter wavelengths of light.\n\n## What each numbered part does (match to the image)\n\n1. **Eyepiece (ocular)** – Magnifies the intermediate image made by the objective; often 10×. Some models include a **diopter** ring to match focus between your eyes.\n\n2. **Head / Body tube** – Holds the optics at fixed spacing so the objective image forms at the correct plane for the eyepiece.\n\n3. **Revolving nosepiece (turret)** – Clicks different **objective lenses** into the light path quickly.\n\n4. **Objectives (4×, 10×, 40×, 100× oil)** – The primary magnifiers; also the main drivers of **resolution** and **working distance**.\n\n   * **4× (scanning):** wide field, easy to find the specimen.\n   * **10× (low):** more detail, still forgiving.\n   * **40× (high dry):** fine detail; use **fine focus only**.\n   * **100× oil:** highest detail; requires immersion oil to boost NA and resolution.\n\n5. **Stage** – Platform that holds the slide. Often a **mechanical stage** with **X–Y controls** for precise movement.\n\n6. **Slide & stage clips** – Secure the specimen directly over the light path.\n\n7. **Coarse focus knob** – Moves the stage quickly to find focus at low power.\n\n8. **Fine focus knob** – Small, precise motion for sharp focus, especially at 40×/100×.\n\n9. **Condenser** – A lens system that concentrates light onto the specimen; usually raised close to the underside of the slide for brightfield.\n\n10. **Iris diaphragm (substage)** – Adjustable aperture beneath the condenser. **Open** for brightness and resolution; **close** for more contrast (but less resolution). Use together with the condenser height.\n\n11. **Field diaphragm (if present)** – Controls the illuminated field size; helps set Köhler illumination and reduce stray light.\n\n12. **Illuminator / LED** – The light source. Often paired with a **brightness control** on the base.\n\n13. **On/Off & brightness control** – Powers the lamp and sets intensity to a comfortable, non-glary level.\n\n14. **Arm** – Structural support; the safe handle when carrying the scope (other hand under the base).\n\n15. **Base & power connector** – House the lamp and electronics; provides stability.\n\n### What’s happening to the image?\n\n* **Illuminator → condenser → specimen:** Light is focused into a cone that passes through the specimen. Transparent/colored areas transmit or absorb light differently, creating contrast.\n* **Specimen → objective:** The objective produces a **real, inverted** magnified image inside the tube.\n* **Objective image → eyepiece:** The eyepiece acts like a magnifier, creating a **virtual image** your eye focuses on.\n* **Result:** High magnification with limited depth of field; tiny focus adjustments and proper illumination are crucial.\n\nIf you want, I can make a printable one-page “How it works + parts” handout using this same diagram.\n",
