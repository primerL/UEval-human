When tectonic forces push, pull, or shear the crust, stress builds along the fault.\n\nHow faults cause earthquakes (the stick-slip cycle):\n1.\tLocked: Rough fault surfaces “stick” due to friction while plate motion keeps stressing them.\n2.\tStrain builds: Rock around the fault elastically bends and stores energy.\n3.\tRupture: When stress exceeds frictional strength, the fault suddenly slips. The break starts at the hypocenter (focus) at depth and spreads along the fault.\n4.\tSeismic waves: Stored elastic energy radiates as P and S waves that shake the ground. The point on the surface above the focus is the epicenter.\n5.\tAftershocks: The crust adjusts to the new positions, producing smaller quakes on or near the same fault.\n\nMain fault types & the stresses that create them:\n•\tNormal fault (tension/extension): Crust is pulled apart; the hanging wall moves down.\n•\tReverse/thrust fault (compression): Crust is squeezed; the hanging wall moves up (common in subduction zones and mountain belts).\n•\tStrike-slip fault (shear): Blocks slide horizontally past each other (e.g., transform boundaries); motion can be right-lateral or left-lateral.\n\nWhy some places shake more:\nMost large earthquakes occur at plate boundaries where stress accumulates fastest: subduction zones (big thrust quakes), continental collisions (reverse faults), and major transforms (strike-slip).\n\nImage generated separately above: labeled diagram showing a fault plane, the earthquake cycle with hypocenter/epicenter and waves, plus normal/reverse/strike-slip fault insets.",

In optics, a ray is an idealized model of light, obtained by choosing a line that is perpendicular to the wave fronts of the actual light, and that points in the direction of energy flow. Rays are used to model the propagation of light through an optical system by dividing the real light field up into discrete rays that can be computationally propagated through the system by the techniques of ray tracing. All three rays should meet at the same point. The Principal Ray or Chief Ray in an optical system is the meridional ray that starts at the edge of the object and passes through the center of the aperture stop. This ray crosses the optical axis at the locations of the pupils. The Central Ray is perpendicular to infrared radiation. The Focal Ray is drawn from the tip of the object through (or towards) the focal point, reflecting off the mirror parallel to the principal axis.",

In geometric optics we treat light as straight-line rays that are perpendicular to wavefronts and that obey the rules of **reflection** (angle in = angle out) and **refraction** (Snell’s law) at boundaries.\n\n**Main types of rays you see in ray diagrams**\n\n1. **Incident ray** – the incoming ray that strikes a surface or boundary.\n2. **Reflected ray** – the ray that bounces off a mirror; its angle to the normal equals the incident angle.\n3. **Refracted (transmitted) ray** – the ray that passes into a new medium and bends according to Snell’s law.\n4. **Principal rays** – standard, easy-to-trace rays used to locate images with thin lenses and spherical mirrors:\n\n* **For thin lenses**\n\n  * **Parallel (P) ray:** parallel to the principal axis; after the lens it passes through the focal point (F) (converging lens) or appears to come from (F) (diverging lens).\n  * **Focal (F) ray:** aimed toward the focal point before the lens; emerges parallel to the axis (roles swap for diverging lenses).\n  * **Central/Chief (O) ray:** passes through the optical center and continues essentially undeviated.\n\n* **For spherical mirrors**\n\n  * **Parallel (P) ray:** parallel to the axis; reflects through (F) (concave) or appears to come from (F) behind the mirror (convex).\n  * **Focal (F) ray:** goes through (F); reflects parallel to the axis.\n  * **Center-of-curvature (C) ray:** goes through the center of curvature; reflects back on itself.\n\nIn diagrams, **solid lines** usually show real rays; **dashed extensions** show virtual rays that appear to originate from a point.\n\n---\n\n# Image\n\nI’ve generated a labeled teaching diagram that shows:\n\n* Principal rays for a **converging lens**, **diverging lens**, **concave mirror**, and **convex mirror** (with objects and images).\n* Small insets for **reflection at a plane mirror** and **refraction at a boundary** with angles labeled.\n\nIf you’d like any changes—different colors, thicker lines, or additional cases (e.g., object between (F) and the lens)—say the word and I’ll regenerate it.\n",

This slows the escape of heat to space and **warms the lower atmosphere and surface** until a balance is reached between incoming sunlight and outgoing infrared.\n\n**Without the natural greenhouse effect,** Earth’s average surface temperature would be about **−18 °C (0 °F)**.\n**With it,** the average is about **+15 °C (59 °F)** — warm enough for **liquid water, stable climates, and the ecosystems and agriculture** life depends on.\n\n> Note: Adding extra greenhouse gases (e.g., rising CO₂ and CH₄) **enhances** the effect, shifting the balance and driving **modern climate change**.\n\n---\n\n**Image:** A labeled infographic illustrating the steps above (Sunlight in, reflection, surface warming, infrared out, greenhouse gases re-emitting heat, and the −18 °C vs +15 °C note).",

Above that, lighter gases become more common (start of the **heterosphere**).\n* **Ionosphere:** Not a separate “layer” by altitude alone; it **overlaps** the mesosphere/thermosphere (\\~60–1,000 km) and is defined by ionization from solar radiation (important for auroras and radio).\n\nIf you’d like, I can add typical Celsius/°F scale values on the temperature curve or include example altitudes for planes, balloons, meteors, the ISS, and GPS satellites.\n",

Most ocean carbon is stored as bicarbonate/carbonate, buffering the atmosphere.\n3. **Biological pump:** Phytoplankton photosynthesize; part of their organic matter and the **CaCO₃ shells** from calcifying organisms sink, carrying carbon to the **deep ocean**. Much is respired at depth (CO₂ stored for decades–centuries) and later **upwells** back to the surface and air.\n\n## 3) Route from plant carbon → **fossil fuels** (slow cycle)\n\nOnly a tiny fraction of plant carbon escapes decomposition and fire:\n\n1. **Rapid burial in anoxic settings:** In swamps, peatlands, deltas, or marine muds, dead plant/algal matter is buried faster than it decays. Low oxygen slows microbes.\n2. **Diagenesis & maturation (heat + pressure + time):**\n\n   * **Terrestrial plants → peat → lignite → coal.**\n   * **Marine algae/zooplankton → organic-rich muds → kerogen → oil & natural gas.**\n3. **Geologic storage:** These hydrocarbons remain trapped in rocks for millions of years unless exposed, uplifted, or extracted.\n\n## 4) Weathering, rocks, and volcanoes (slow geologic loop)\n\n1. **Silicate weathering (atmosphere → rivers → ocean):** CO₂ in rainwater forms weak acid that weathers rocks; dissolved bicarbonate flows to the ocean.\n2. **Carbonate formation:** Marine organisms and chemistry turn bicarbonate into **limestone/dolomite (CaCO₃/MgCO₃)** that gets buried as rock.\n3. **Subduction & degassing:** Tectonics carry carbonates and organic sediments into the mantle; **volcanoes** and metamorphism return CO₂ to the atmosphere.\n\n## 5) Human accelerators\n\n* **Fossil fuel extraction & combustion → atmosphere:** Moves carbon from the slow reservoir (coal/oil/gas) to the fast one as CO₂.\n* **Cement production:** Releases CO₂ when limestone is calcined.\n* **Deforestation & land-use change:** Reduces photosynthetic uptake and releases stored biomass/soil carbon.\n* **Methane leaks & agriculture:** Add CH₄, which later becomes CO₂.\n* **Permafrost thaw/peatland drainage:** Frees long-stored organic carbon as CO₂/CH₄.\n* **Ocean uptake & acidification:** Extra atmospheric CO₂ drives more dissolution, shifting seawater chemistry and affecting calcifiers.\n\n## 6) Direct answers to your two “where does plant carbon go?” questions\n\n* **Into the atmosphere:** through plant/animal **respiration**, **microbial decay** (CO₂/CH₄), **fires**, and **human burning** of biomass or extracted fossil fuels.\n* **Into fossil fuels:** when dead plant (or algal) material is **rapidly buried in oxygen-poor sediments**, then **cooked by heat and pressure** for **geologic timescales**, transforming into **coal (mainly land plants)** or **oil/gas (mainly marine algae/zooplankton)**.\n\nIf you’d like, I can tailor a simpler “student cheat-sheet” version or add typical timescales and example environments for each arrow.\n",

This is the **mucociliary escalator**.\n\n**3) What happens to the trapped stuff.**\n\n* When the mucus reaches the throat, you **swallow** it. Stomach acid and enzymes break down most contaminants.\n* If there’s a lot of irritation, sensors trigger a **cough or sneeze**, which blasts mucus and particles out.\n\n**4) Deep areas without cilia: the alveoli.**\n\n* The tiny air sacs (alveoli) handle gas exchange and **don’t have cilia**.\n* Here, roaming **alveolar macrophages** (patrolling immune cells) **eat** fine particles and microbes.\n* What they collect is carried away via the mucociliary escalator (after they crawl to ciliated regions) or through **lymphatic drainage**.\n\n**5) Size matters (where particles tend to land).**\n\n* **Large** (> ~10 μm): mostly stopped in the **nose/throat**.\n* **Medium** (~2.5–10 μm): settle in the **trachea/bronchi**, cleared by cilia.\n* **Fine** (< ~2.5 μm): can reach the **alveoli**, handled by macrophages.\n* **Gases/ultrafine** may be absorbed or exhaled.\n\n**6) When the system struggles.**\n\n* **Dry air, dehydration, smoking, or pollutants** can thicken or paralyze mucus/cilia.\n* Certain conditions (e.g., **asthma**, **chronic bronchitis**, **cystic fibrosis**, or **primary ciliary dyskinesia**) reduce clearance, so particles linger and infections are more likely.\n\n**Quick recap:** your airways trap particles in mucus, **cilia sweep** that mucus upward, and **cough/sneeze or swallowing** removes it; deep in the lungs, **macrophages** finish the cleanup.\n\nIf you’d like, I can add labels or callouts to the diagram tailored to a specific class level (middle school vs. college).\n",

Light from the **illuminator** is focused through the specimen by the **condenser**. The **objective** forms a **real, inverted intermediate image** inside the tube; the **eyepiece** then magnifies that into the **virtual image** you see.\n\n**Total magnification = (eyepiece power) × (objective power).**\n**Resolution** (smallest detail you can separate) improves with higher **NA** of the objective/condenser and with shorter wavelengths of light.\n\n## What each numbered part does (match to the image)\n\n1. **Eyepiece (ocular)** – Magnifies the intermediate image made by the objective; often 10×. Some models include a **diopter** ring to match focus between your eyes.\n\n2. **Head / Body tube** – Holds the optics at fixed spacing so the objective image forms at the correct plane for the eyepiece.\n\n3. **Revolving nosepiece (turret)** – Clicks different **objective lenses** into the light path quickly.\n\n4. **Objectives (4×, 10×, 40×, 100× oil)** – The primary magnifiers; also the main drivers of **resolution** and **working distance**.\n\n   * **4× (scanning):** wide field, easy to find the specimen.\n   * **10× (low):** more detail, still forgiving.\n   * **40× (high dry):** fine detail; use **fine focus only**.\n   * **100× oil:** highest detail; requires immersion oil to boost NA and resolution.\n\n5. **Stage** – Platform that holds the slide. Often a **mechanical stage** with **X–Y controls** for precise movement.\n\n6. **Slide & stage clips** – Secure the specimen directly over the light path.\n\n7. **Coarse focus knob** – Moves the stage quickly to find focus at low power.\n\n8. **Fine focus knob** – Small, precise motion for sharp focus, especially at 40×/100×.\n\n9. **Condenser** – A lens system that concentrates light onto the specimen; usually raised close to the underside of the slide for brightfield.\n\n10. **Iris diaphragm (substage)** – Adjustable aperture beneath the condenser. **Open** for brightness and resolution; **close** for more contrast (but less resolution). Use together with the condenser height.\n\n11. **Field diaphragm (if present)** – Controls the illuminated field size; helps set Köhler illumination and reduce stray light.\n\n12. **Illuminator / LED** – The light source. Often paired with a **brightness control** on the base.\n\n13. **On/Off & brightness control** – Powers the lamp and sets intensity to a comfortable, non-glary level.\n\n14. **Arm** – Structural support; the safe handle when carrying the scope (other hand under the base).\n\n15. **Base & power connector** – House the lamp and electronics; provides stability.\n\n### What’s happening to the image?\n\n* **Illuminator → condenser → specimen:** Light is focused into a cone that passes through the specimen. Transparent/colored areas transmit or absorb light differently, creating contrast.\n* **Specimen → objective:** The objective produces a **real, inverted** magnified image inside the tube.\n* **Objective image → eyepiece:** The eyepiece acts like a magnifier, creating a **virtual image** your eye focuses on.\n* **Result:** High magnification with limited depth of field; tiny focus adjustments and proper illumination are crucial.\n\nIf you want, I can make a printable one-page “How it works + parts” handout using this same diagram.\n",

Often shows layers and may contain fossils.\n* **Metamorphic** – forms when any rock is **changed by heat and pressure** (without melting). Minerals **recrystallize** and may align into bands (e.g., slate, gneiss).\n\n## Main pathways (follow the arrows)\n\n1. **Magma → Igneous**: cooling & crystallization.\n2. **Igneous → Sediments**: uplift exposes rock; weathering breaks it down; erosion moves it.\n3. **Sediments → Sedimentary rock**: burial + compaction + cementation (lithification).\n4. **Sedimentary → Metamorphic**: deeper burial adds heat & pressure; minerals reorganize.\n5. **Metamorphic → Magma**: if heating goes far enough, the rock **melts**.\n6. **Shortcuts**:\n\n   * Any rock type can **weather & erode** back to **sediments**.\n   * **Igneous → Metamorphic** directly (heat & pressure).\n   * **Sedimentary → Magma** if it melts (usually via subduction).\n   * **Metamorphic → Sedimentary** if uplifted, weathered, and re-lithified.\n\n## What drives the cycle?\n\n* **Plate tectonics**: subduction drags rocks deep (heat, pressure, melting); collisions uplift mountains (exposure & weathering).\n* **Water, ice, wind**: power weathering & erosion at the surface.\n* **Heat from Earth’s interior**: fuels metamorphism and melting.\n\n## Quick ID tips\n\n* **Igneous**: interlocking crystals; sometimes glassy or with gas holes.\n* **Sedimentary**: visible grains or fossils; layered or crumbly cement.\n* **Metamorphic**: stretched/banded minerals; harder, denser versions of earlier rocks.\n\n## Big idea\n\nThe rock cycle isn’t a single loop—it’s a **network of paths**.

    "reference_text": "The diagram shows the structures of the respiratory system. They include the nose, trachea, lungs, and diaphragm. The diaphragm is a large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs. When you inhale, air enters the respiratory system through your nose and ends up in your lungs, where gas exchange with the blood takes place. In the nose, mucus and hairs trap any dust or other particles in the air. The air is also warmed and moistened so it wont harm delicate tissues of the lungs. Next, air passes through the pharynx, a passageway that is shared with the digestive system. From the pharynx, the air passes next through the larynx, or voice box. After the larynx, air moves into the trachea, or wind pipe. This is a long tube that leads down to the lungs in the chest. In the chest, the trachea divides as it enters the lungs to form the right and left bronchi (bronchus, singular). These passages are covered with mucus and tiny hairs called cilia. The mucus traps any remaining particles in the air. The cilia move and sweep the particles and mucus toward the throat so they can be expelled from the body. Air passes from the bronchi into smaller passages called bronchioles. The bronchioles end in clusters of tiny air sacs called alveoli (alveolus, singular). The alveoli in the lungs are where gas exchange between the air and blood takes place. Shown also is the rib (or ribs) the protect the lungs and other vital organs within the chest.",

It’s often divided into:\n\n* **Upper respiratory tract:** nose/nostrils, nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, and pharynx (throat).\n* **Lower respiratory tract:** larynx (voice box), trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and lungs (ending in alveoli).\n* **Supporting structures:** chest wall, **diaphragm**, intercostal muscles, and the **pleura** (the double-layer lining around the lungs).\n\n## The parts, in order\n\n1. **Nostrils (nares) & nasal vestibule** – entry points. Nose hairs and mucus trap dust; blood-rich lining warms and humidifies air.\n   *(If you breathe through your mouth, the first steps below are bypassed.)*\n2. **Nasal cavity & turbinates** – twisty shelves that swirl air to filter, warm, and moisten it; smell receptors live high up.\n3. **Paranasal sinuses** (frontal, maxillary, ethmoid, sphenoid) – air-filled spaces that lighten the skull and condition air; drain into the nasal cavity.\n4. **Pharynx (throat)** – three regions:\n\n   * **Nasopharynx** (behind the nose)\n   * **Oropharynx** (behind the mouth; food + air share this space)\n   * **Laryngopharynx** (leads to the larynx for air or esophagus for food)\n5. **Epiglottis** – a leaf-shaped flap that tilts down when you swallow so food doesn’t enter the airway.\n6. **Larynx (voice box)** – contains vocal cords; the opening between them is the **glottis**.\n7. **Trachea (windpipe)** – rigid tube with C-shaped cartilage rings; lined with cilia that sweep debris upward (the “mucociliary escalator”).\n8. **Carina** – the tracheal split.\n9. **Main bronchi** – right and left primary branches; the **right main bronchus** is shorter, wider, and more vertical (aspired objects lodge here more often).\n10. **Lobar (secondary) bronchi** – one to each lung lobe (3 right, 2 left).\n11. **Segmental (tertiary) bronchi** – supply bronchopulmonary segments.\n12. **Conducting bronchioles → terminal bronchioles** – small airways without cartilage; still just conducting air (no gas exchange yet).\n13. **Respiratory bronchioles → alveolar ducts → alveolar sacs → alveoli** – the **respiratory zone** where oxygen enters blood and carbon dioxide leaves across the ultra-thin alveolar–capillary membrane. Type II cells make **surfactant** to keep alveoli open.\n\n**Around the lungs:**\n\n* **Pleura:** visceral layer on the lung, parietal layer on the chest wall; a thin fluid layer lets lungs glide during breathing.\n* **Diaphragm & intercostals:** main breathing muscles.\n\n## How air travels (step-by-step)\n\n1. **Inhale:** Diaphragm contracts and moves down, ribs lift—chest cavity expands, drawing air in.\n2. **Air path:** Nostrils → nasal cavity (or mouth) → pharynx → past epiglottis → **larynx** → **trachea** → **carina** → **right/left main bronchi** → lobar bronchi → segmental bronchi → bronchioles → terminal bronchioles → **respiratory bronchioles** → **alveolar ducts** → **alveolar sacs** → **alveoli**.\n3. **Gas exchange:** Oxygen diffuses from alveoli to blood; carbon dioxide diffuses from blood to alveoli.\n4. **Exhale:** Diaphragm relaxes and moves up; lungs recoil and air flows out along the same path in reverse.\n\n## Quick memory trick\n\n**“N-N-P-L-T-B-B-b-b-A”** → Nose, Nasal cavity, Pharynx, Larynx, Trachea, Bronchi (main → lobar → segmental), bronchioles (conducting → terminal), **A**lveoli (via respiratory bronchioles & ducts).\n\n---\n\nIf you’d like, I can add labels or callouts tailored to your study needs (e.g., “conducting vs. respiratory zone,” or a zoom-in on the vocal cords).\n",

    "reference_text": "The diagram shows the human digestive system. It has several organs such as the liver, stomach, pancreas and intestines. Food enters the digestive system through the mouth and exits the system through the anus. The esophagus is a long tube that connects the mouth and the stomach. In the stomach, chemicals called enzymes change the food into smaller molecules that the body can use. The pancreas is the part of the digestive system that produces important enzymes and hormones that help break down foods. It is located in the abdominal cavity behind the stomach. In the small intestine, our bodies absorb the nutrients from our food. Finally, the large intestine mixes the solid waste material with water so we can easily eliminate it from our bodies through the anus. Overall, there are 9 main organs in the Digestive system.",
