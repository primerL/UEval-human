    "question": "How to set up a Gmail account? Provide a visual guide and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Go to https://accounts.google.com in a browser. This will open the Google Account sign-in page. If you already have a Google account, you’ll need to sign out before you can continue. 2. Click Create account . You’ll find this small blue link near the bottom of the page, next to the Next button. 3. Select your account type from the menu. A menu will pop up with a few options to choose from. Select either For my personal use , For my child , or For work or my business . If you’re trying to create a business account, you might want to consider signing up for a Google Workspace account instead. The process for creating a child’s account is very similar to creating a personal account for yourself. You’ll need to provide information such as your child’s name, birthdate, and desired email address. However, you’ll also need to sign in with your Gmail account to provide parental consent for their account. 4. Enter your first and last name. Type your first name into the \"First name\" text box, then enter your last name in the \"Last name\" box underneath it. You must enter a first name, but the last name is optional. If you're creating a Gmail account for a friend or a child, enter their information in the fields provided. 5. Enter your birth date and gender. On the next page, you’ll be prompted to provide your birthdate (month, day, and year) and gender. If you don’t identify as male or female, select Custom to see additional options. You can also select Rather not say . Click Next when you’re done. Google asks for your birthdate because some Google services have specific age requirements. Google may also use this information to personalize your experience. If you decide to provide your gender, Google will use this information to personalize your account—e.g., by using your preferred pronouns in text that refers to you. 6. Select or create a custom email address. On the next page, you’ll be offered some automatically generated email addresses based on your name. If you don’t want any of those, select Create your own Gmail address and type in your preferred username. You can use a combination of letters, numbers, and periods. This is the text that will appear before “@gmail.com” in your email address. Click Next when you’re done. You must enter a unique username that isn't being used by someone else. If it's taken, you'll see: That username is taken. Try another. If the username you want is taken, add a number at the end or change the spelling. Sometimes Google will reject a username if it’s extremely similar to one that somebody else is using (even if there are slight differences), if someone else had that username in the past and then deleted it, or if Google has reserved the name to prevent abuse or spam. 7. Enter and confirm your new password. Type your preferred password into the \"Password\" text box, then type the same password into the \"Confirm\" box underneath it. Check the Show password box to see what you are typing. Click Next when you’re done. These passwords must match before you can proceed. Make sure to use a strong password to avoid any unauthorized access to your account. 8. Enter a recovery email. Google will contact you at your recovery email address if something goes wrong with your new account—e.g. if you get locked out or Google detects unusual activity from your address. Click Next when you’re done. If you don’t have an alternate email, or if you’d rather set up recovery options later, click Skip . 9. Review your info and select Next . On the next page, you’ll see your new account name and email address. If it looks good, click Next . Otherwise, you can use your browser’s Back button to go back and make changes to the information you entered in the previous steps. 10. Agree to the Terms of Service. On the next page, you’ll be prompted to agree to Google’s terms and privacy policy. Once you’ve reviewed them, click I agree . If you change your mind, click Cancel instead. 11. Confirm your personalization options. A window will pop up asking if you want to agree to Google’s personalization options. Click Confirm to continue, or select More options to change your settings. 12. Customize your account settings. Once you verify your new address, you’ll be taken to the Google Account home page. From here, you can adjust settings such as: Your account recovery information. Add a recovery email here if you didn’t already, or add a phone number so you have two recovery options. Set a home address for a more personalized experience. For example, Google will show you weather reports and map results based on your address. Adjust your privacy and security settings and review privacy recommendations for your account. Add contacts or set up a family group. 13. Go to https://mail.google.com to access your Gmail. You should be automatically logged into your new account. If not, you’ll be prompted to sign in. The first time you visit this page, you’ll see options to customize your inbox, set a profile image, and add or import contacts. To write and send an email, click Compose in the top left corner. To see your emails, click the Inbox tab on the left side of the page. Use the tabs at the top of your inbox on the right to view different categories such as regular emails (in Primary ), marketing related emails (in Promotions ), or email notifications from various social media platforms (in Social ). In the menu on the left, you can also browse your drafts, sent emails, scheduled messages, your spam folder, and more. Adjust your settings by clicking the Settings icon at the top right side of the page. To sign out of your account, tap your initial or profile picture at the top right corner of the page, then select Sign Out .",

    "question": "How to Connect One Router to Another to Expand a Network？ Provide steps with images and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Connect the modem to the first router. Use an Ethernet cable to connect to the WAN port of a router to the WAN/Internet port of the high-speed modem. For the purpose of this wikiHow, we will refer to the router that’s connected to the modem as “Router 1.\" Some routers act as a high-speed modem and router. If this is the case for Router 1, simply connect it to the cable that carries your internet connection. The WAN port may be labeled “Internet.” 2. Connect Router 1 to a computer. Use an Ethernet cable to connect from one of Router 1’s LAN ports to a computer’s Ethernet port. You can also connect to the router wirelessly using the wi-fi name and passkey. 3. Turn on the modem and Router 1. Allow a few moments for them both to boot up. 4. Open a web browser. You’ll need a web browser to connect to the admin user interface of Router 1. 5. Enter Router 1's IP address in the address bar. Type the IP address for Router 1 into the address bar at the top of your web browser. This opens the router's admin login screen. Check the user's manual or manufacturer's website to find the default IP address for Router 1. Here are some default IP addresses for common router brands: 2Wire: 192.168.1.1, 192.168.0.1, 192.168.1.254, 10.0.0.138 Apple: 10.0.0.1 Belkin: 192.168.1.1, 192.168.2.1, 10.0.0.2, 10.1.1.1 Dlink: 192.168.1.1, 192.168.0.1, 192.168.0.101, 192.168.0.30, 192.168.0.50, 192.168.15.1, 192.168.254.254, 192.168.1.254, 192.168.0.10, 192.168.15.1, 10.0.0.1, 10.0.0.2, 10.1.1.1, 10.90.90.90, Netgear: 192.168.0.1, 192.168.0.227 6. Log in using Router 1's admin username and password. This opens Router 1's admin user interface. Check the user's manual, or the manufacturer's website to find the default username and password for the Router 1. Most router's use \"admin\" as the username and password. You can also try \"Password\" or \"12345678\" as the password. For some router's, the username or password is left blank. If you’re using the right password but still can’t connect, check the user's manual or manufacturer's website to learn how to reset the router's to it's factory settings. 7. Enable DHCP on Router 1. This will allow Router 1 to assign all of the IP addresses in your network. You can usually find these settings under “Network settings,” or “LAN settings.” The admin user interface layout is different from one router make and model to another. In most cases, the DHCP server is turned on by default. 8. Test your network and internet connection. [6] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source Visit any website (like https://www.wikihow.com ) to verify that you can connect to the Internet. Make sure that the physical configuration of your network leaves room for one LAN port to be open on Router 1. 9. Disconnect Router 1 from the computer. Remove the Ethernet cable between Router 1 and the computer. Everything else can remain on and plugged in. 10. Plug the second router in and turn it on. Make sure you have a free electrical outlet and a computer near where you want the second router to be located. Plug it in and turn it on. For the purposes of this wikiHow, we will refer to the second router as \"Router 2\". 11. Connect a computer to the Router 2. Use an Ethernet cable to connect to the LAN port on Router 2. Then connect to the Ethernet port on a computer. 12. Type Router 2's IP address in the address bar of a web browser. This opens the admin login screen for Router 2. With most router's, the IP address is 192.168.0.1, 192.168.1.1, or 10.0.0.1. 13. Log in using Router 2's username and password. Use the default username and password to log in to the admin user interface for Router 2, just as you did with Router 1. Check the user's manual or manufacturer's website to find the default username and password. With most routers, \"admin\" is both the username and password. 14. Disable DHCP on Router 2. Since DHCP is enabled on Router 1, it should be disabled on Router 2 to prevent IP conflicts. Locate the DHCP settings in the admin user interface and switch the DHCP server to “Off.” 15. Assign a new IP address to Router 2. As of now, there’s a good possibility that Routers 1 and 2 have the same default IP address. To prevent IP conflicts, Router 2 needs to have a different IP address than Router 1. Find the area in the routers admin user interface called “LAN” or “Local Network.” There should be a box that contains the current IP address. Type a new IP address in place of the existing one. The new IP address on Router 2 must be on the same subnet as Router 1. This means the first three sets of numbers in the IP address should be the same as Router 1. Change the number after the third period in the IP address to something different from Router 1. It also can’t be an IP currently assigned to another device. 16. Configure Router 2's Wi-Fi name and passkey. They should be identical to Router 1. You should find these settings under a menu called “Wireless”, “Wi-Fi setup”, or something similar If you’re unsure of Router 1’s SSID and passkey, it should be printed on the device. Router 2 is not a wireless router, skip this step. 17. Disconnect the power from Router 2. Now that Router 2’s all set up, it’s a good idea to give it a restart—though, for now, leave the power unplugged instead of turning it right back on. 18. Connect the first router to the second router. Use an Ethernet cable to connect to a LAN port on Router 1. Then connect to the first LAN port on Router 2. Make sure you’re not plugging it into the WAN port as they look similar. 19. Plug Router 2 back in and turn it on. When the router comes back up, it will have the IP address you configured. As long as Router 1 has Internet access, Router 2 will now also be online. 20. Restart the computer that’s connected to Router 2. Anytime you connect a computer to a new network device, it's a good idea to restart your computer. 21. Connect other computers and devices. This can be done wirelessly , or by connecting Ethernet cables to unused LAN ports on either router.

If you want any of them tweaked—colors, labels, or brand-specific screenshots—say the word and I’ll regenerate.)\n\n1. **Overview: Two Ways to Connect One Router to Another**\n2. **LAN-to-LAN (Access Point mode) – step-by-step**\n3. **LAN-to-WAN (Router-behind-Router) – step-by-step**\n4. **Placement & Channel Planning**\n\n# Text Steps\n\n## Before you start\n\n* **Pick your method**\n\n  * **LAN-to-LAN (Access Point/AP mode)** — one big network, seamless roaming. *Recommended for most homes.*\n  * **LAN-to-WAN (Double NAT)** — creates a second, isolated network. *Good for guests, kids, or separating work gear.*\n* **What you need**: Router 1 (already on the internet), Router 2, one Ethernet cable (Cat5e or better), a laptop/phone to configure Router 2.\n\n---\n\n## Option A — LAN-to-LAN (Access Point/AP mode)  *(matches Image 2)*\n\nThis turns Router 2 into a simple access point/switch on the **same** network as Router 1.\n\n1. **Connect to Router 2**\n   Plug your laptop into a LAN port on Router 2 (or join its default Wi-Fi). Open its admin page.\n\n2. **Set Router 2 a fixed LAN IP on Router 1’s subnet**\n\n   * Example: if **Router 1** is `192.168.1.1` and its DHCP pool is `192.168.1.100–192.168.1.199`, set **Router 2** to **`192.168.1.2`**.\n   * Aim for an address **outside** Router 1’s DHCP pool to avoid conflicts.\n\n3. **Turn off DHCP on Router 2**\n   Router 1 will be the only device handing out addresses.\n\n4. **Wi-Fi settings on Router 2**\n\n   * For seamless roaming: **same SSID and password** as Router 1.\n   * Set **different channels** to reduce interference:\n\n     * 2.4 GHz: use **1/6/11** (pick a different one than Router 1).\n     * 5 GHz: pick a different channel band (auto is usually fine).\n\n5. **Wire it LAN-to-LAN**\n   Run an Ethernet cable from a **LAN port** on Router 1 to a **LAN port** on Router 2 (do **not** use Router 2’s WAN port).\n\n6. **Place Router 2 well**\n   Put it roughly midway between dead zones and Router 1 (see Image 4). Avoid metal cabinets, microwaves, and thick concrete walls.\n\n7. **Test**\n   Walk around with your phone—signal should stay strong and your device should keep one IP range (e.g., `192.168.1.x`).\n\n---\n\n## Option B — LAN-to-WAN (Router-behind-Router / Double NAT)  *(matches Image 3)*\n\nThis keeps Router 2 as a full router on a **different** subnet. Devices on Router 2 are isolated from Router 1 unless you add special rules.\n\n1. **Connect to Router 2**\n   Log into the admin page.\n\n2. **Use a different LAN subnet on Router 2**\n\n   * Example: leave **Router 1** at `192.168.1.1`.\n   * Set **Router 2** LAN to **`192.168.2.1`** (or any different private subnet). Keep **DHCP ON** on Router 2.\n\n3. **Wire it LAN-to-WAN**\n   Cable from a **LAN port** on Router 1 to the **WAN/Internet** port on Router 2. WAN on Router 2 should be set to **DHCP/Automatic**.\n\n4. **Wi-Fi settings**\n\n   * You can reuse the same SSID/password or choose a **different** name to make it clear which network is which (e.g., “Home-Guest”).\n\n5. **Test**\n   Devices on Router 2 should receive `192.168.2.x` addresses and have internet.\n   *(Note: gaming consoles, servers, or VPNs may need extra port forwarding because of double NAT.)*\n\n---\n\n## Quick Troubleshooting\n\n* **Can’t reach Router 2 after changing its IP?**\n  Temporarily set your laptop to a manual IP on that subnet (e.g., `192.168.1.10`) and browse to Router 2’s new address.\n* **IP conflict or no internet in AP mode?**\n  Make sure **DHCP is OFF** on Router 2 and its IP doesn’t sit inside Router 1’s DHCP pool.\n* **Wi-Fi drops or poor speeds?**\n  Move Router 2 farther from Router 1 and use different channels (1/6/11 on 2.4 GHz).\n* **Double NAT issues (Option B)**\n  If a device needs inbound connections (server, P2P, gaming), add **port forwarding** on **both** routers or switch to **Option A**.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n* For one seamless home network, use **Option A (LAN-to-LAN/AP mode)**.\n* For a segregated guest or work network, use **Option B (LAN-to-WAN/Double NAT)**.\n\nIf you tell me your current router’s IP and DHCP range, I can plug in exact values for you.\n\",",

    "reference_text": "1. Open your iPhone's Settings . Tap the grey app with gears on it. This app is typically found on the Home Screen. 2. Tap Notifications . It's near the top of the menu. Doing so opens a list of all apps that currently support notifications. 3. Scroll down and tap Instagram . Apps here are listed alphabetically, so you'll find Instagram in the \"I\" section. If Instagram is not appearing, you may need to wait until you've received a notification from someone. If Instagram is still not appearing in the list, even after receiving a notification in the app, uninstall the Instagram app, restart your phone, and then install it again. When you launch the reinstalled app, select Allow Notifications when prompted, and Instagram should appear in the Notifications section of the Settings app. 4. Tap the white \"Allow Notifications\" switch . It's at the top of the screen. Tapping it will cause it to turn green , signifying that Instagram will send notifications to your iPhone. If you want to disable Instagram notifications completely, tap the green \"Allow Notifications\" switch and then skip the rest of this method. 5. Enable or disable other notifications. Tap the white switch to the right of each of the following options to enable them, or tap the green switch next to each of them to disable them: Sounds - Turn on or off Instagram sounds. Badge App Icon - Turn on or off Instagram badge icons, which are the numbers that display in the corner of the Instagram app when you have pending notifications. Show on Lock Screen - Turn on or off notifications that appear on your iPhone's Lock Screen. Show in History - Turn on or off notifications history for Instagram. Notifications history can be checked by swiping down from the top of the screen. Show as Banners - Turn on or off banner-style notifications, which display at the top of the screen when your iPhone is unlocked. 6. Select an alert style. Below the \"Show as Banners\" switch, tap either Temporary or Persistent . This option won't display if you have \"Show as Banners\" turned off. \"Temporary\" alerts appear briefly at the top of your iPhone's screen before disappearing, while \"Persistent\" alerts don't disappear until you swipe them away. 7. Set a preview option. This will determine whether or not you can see the content of an Instagram notification without opening it. Scroll down and tap Show Previews , then select one of the following options: Always (Default) - You will always see previews for Instagram notifications (e.g., \"Sarah liked your post\"). When Unlocked - You will see previews for Instagram notifications when your iPhone is unlocked. Never - You will never see previews for Instagram notifications. 8. Tap the \"Back\" button twice. It's in the top-left corner of the screen. This will take you back to the Notifications page, saving your changes in the process. Instagram will now send you notifications.",

These hotkeys are represented by two different images of a sun, one for increasing and another for decreasing brightness. Find the keys on your keyboard to get started. These hotkeys will look slightly different on every computer. They are often differentiated by a filled-in sun (decrease) and an empty sun (increase) or a sun with dots for rays (decrease) and a sun with lines for rays (increase). Also be on the lookout for arrows pointing upwards or downwards, indicating an increase or decrease in brightness. These hotkeys will be mapped onto different buttons on different keyboards. Check out your left and right arrow keys, or the function keys (F1, F2, etc.) lining the top of your keyboard. 2. Hold down the \"Fn\" key on your keyboard. The brightness hotkeys are not the primary function of the keys they are mapped onto. You'll therefore needed to hold down the Fn key while you adjust your screen's brightness. 3. Tap the appropriate hotkeys. While holding Fn , tap the corresponding hotkeys to turn your PC's brightness up or down.",

Logs titled analyticsd.diskwrites will not work for this method. If you're on iOS 15 or earlier, the correct analytics log will be titled log-aggregated . 7. Copy the log into a text editor. You can use the Notes app on your iPad or you can export the log file to a computer. 8. Search for MaximumCapacityPercent . The number after that phrase is your current maximum battery capacity. This number is a percentage, so if your log gives you a 90 after this number, your battery capacity is at 90%. You can search the log by using Find in Note if you're using the Notes app. Find in Note is located under the three-dot menu in the upper right-hand corner. On a computer, you can use the Find function , which is available in most text editors by clicking Ctrl + F on Windows or Cmd + F Mac. 9. Search for CycleCount . The number after that phrase is the current battery cycle count. Every time your iPad battery is charged from 0 to 100, that counts as a cycle.
