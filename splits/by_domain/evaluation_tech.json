    "reference_text": "1. Press ⌘ Command + ⇧ Shift + 3 . This keyboard shortcut takes a screenshot of everything on your screen. Make sure your screen displays exactly what you want to show in your screenshot image. Ensure all the relevant windows are visible. If your sound is on, your computer should make a brief camera shutter noise. If you see a thumbnail in the corner, you can click it to edit the screenshot. Otherwise, wait a few seconds for the screenshot to save onto your desktop. 2. Find your screenshot on your desktop. It will be a .png file named \"Screen Shot\" labeled with the date and time. Earlier versions of OS X will save it as \"Picture #\"—for example, if it's the 5th screenshot on your desktop it will be labeled \"Picture 5\". Once you have taken your screenshots, they are now ready to be used as needed. You can attach them to an email, upload them to the Web, or even drag them straight into an application such as a word processor. 3. Press ⌘ Command + ⇧ Shift + 4 . Your cursor will turn into a small crosshair reticle.

Click and drag your cursor to highlight the area you'd like to take a picture of. A gray rectangle should appear where you drag your cursor. If you need to adjust your windows at all, press Escape to return to a regular cursor without taking a picture. 5. Let go of the mouse. You should hear a brief camera shutter noise if your computer's sound is turned on. That signals that your screenshot has been taken. 6. Find your screenshot on your desktop.

    "reference_text": "1. Find the appropriate keys on your keyboard. Windows 10 PCs allow you to adjust your brightness using hotkeys on your keyboard. These hotkeys are represented by two different images of a sun, one for increasing and another for decreasing brightness. Find the keys on your keyboard to get started. These hotkeys will look slightly different on every computer. They are often differentiated by a filled-in sun (decrease) and an empty sun (increase) or a sun with dots for rays (decrease) and a sun with lines for rays (increase). Also be on the lookout for arrows pointing upwards or downwards, indicating an increase or decrease in brightness. These hotkeys will be mapped onto different buttons on different keyboards. Check out your left and right arrow keys, or the function keys (F1, F2, etc.) lining the top of your keyboard. 2. Hold down the \"Fn\" key on your keyboard. The brightness hotkeys are not the primary function of the keys they are mapped onto. You'll therefore needed to hold down the Fn key while you adjust your screen's brightness. 3. Tap the appropriate hotkeys. While holding Fn , tap the corresponding hotkeys to turn your PC's brightness up or down.",

    "question": "How to connect a Wi-Fi network on a laptop? Provide a visual guide and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Get a wireless router. Most ISPs will supply you with both a Wi-Fi router and modem, or a Wi-Fi router/modem combo. If your ISP only provides a modem, or you don't want to rent a Wi-Fi router from them, you can buy your own. Various factors will determine which router is best for you, including speed, bandwidth capabilities, and Wi-Fi coverage/distance. Speed These days, all wireless routers (even the budget models) are pretty fast. If you need ultra-fast Wi-Fi speeds—perhaps multiple devices will be streaming movies in 4k or 8k, gaming, or sharing large amounts of data at the same time—opt for a router with Wi-Fi 7 technology . If you're on a budget and want blazingly fast but don't need extreme , opt for a Wi-Fi 6 router . Distance If you have a very large home, consider a mesh router system instead of a standalone Wi-Fi router. Mesh Wi-Fi systems consist of a router with a series of nodes to expand the coverage in all areas of your home. 2.4GHz or 5Ghz 2.4 GHz covers a wider distance, is supported by more devices, and is good at penetrating walls and large furniture. However, it's more prone to interference because more devices (including cordless phones) use this frequency. 5 GHz is faster and less prone to interference, but it does have a smaller coverage area and cannot penetrate solid objects as well as 2.4GHz. Security The highest level of security is WPA3, but some devices (including Nintendo Switch) don't support it. Choose a router that has a WPA2/WPA3 Transitional mode, which allows newer devices to use WPA3 and older devices to use WPA2. 2. Connect the modem to the appropriate port on your wall. If you have a separate modem, connect it to the DSL, cable, or fiber port on your wall using the cable provided to you by your ISP, and turn the unit on. If the modem and router are one unit, connect that to the wall port, and turn the unit on. 3. Connect the router to your modem and turn it on. If the router is separate from the modem, you'll need to connect it to the modem using an ethernet cable. Plug one end of the cable into the port on the back of the router labeled WAN/WLAN/Internet or similar, and the other end into the modem's LAN port. 4. Place your router. For the best possible signal , position the wireless router in a central location, away from walls and metal objects, and not on the floor. [3] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source Any obstacles will degrade the signal. Remember that it must be physically connected to your modem, so this may limit your options when placing the router. 5. Connect your computer or phone to the router. Some routers have a mobile app you can install that makes Wi-Fi setup a breeze—check your router's documentation to see if you can download an app and use it to set up your router. If not, you'll need to connect your computer to the router using an ethernet cable to set up your wireless network. 6. Log in to the router's admin page. If you connected your computer via ethernet, you'll need to open the router's configuration page and sign in with the admin password. Open a web browser and enter the router's web address. According to Showers, the IP address is typically https://192.168.1.1, https://192.168.0.1, or https://10.0.0.1, but can vary based on the router model. [4] X Expert Source Tyrone Showers Technologist Expert Interview Consult the documentation that came with the router to find the exact address. The router will ask you for a login name and password, or sometimes just a password. The password you'll need to use is in your router's documentation or sometimes printed on a sticker on the back of the router. If you bought a used router, you can find the default admin password for most routers at https://portforward.com/router-password . 7. Enter your internet connection information. In most cases, your router should obtain this information automatically from your modem. If it doesn't, you may need to enter some information about your internet connection—often a username and password and DNS server addresses. If you're not sure what to enter, contact your ISP. 8. Set up your Wi-Fi access point. Locate the Wireless or Wi-Fi section of your router's configuration page. You can enable Wi-Fi, change the network name, and set the security level here. The \"SSID\" field is where you'll enter a name for your Wi-Fi router. This is the name people will see when they want to connect to the internet. If you live in an area with a lot of public traffic, avoid putting any identifiable information in the SSID, as anyone with a wireless device can see it. Make sure to set the security/encryption to the latest version allowed by your router. This will most likely be WPA3 (best) or WPA2 (less good, but more compatible with older devices). Create a password for your Wi-Fi network. While this is not required, Showers recommends it. \"Creating a strong password, combining letters, numbers, and special characters is important to enhance security,\" he says. [5] X Expert Source Tyrone Showers Technologist Expert Interview 9. Apply your settings. Make sure you click the Apply or Save Changes button in your router's configuration when you are done changing the settings. The router will process for a moment (or reboot), and your new settings will take effect. 10. Connect your devices to Wi-Fi. Once the router is online, you can connect your Wi-Fi capable devices so they can access the internet. Android Swipe down from the top of the screen. Tap and hold the Wi-Fi icon to open your Wi-Fi settings. Slide the \"Wi-Fi\" switch to \"ON\" (or tap the option to Use Wi-Fi ). Select your Wi-Fi network name. iPhone or iPad Open Settings . Tap Wi-Fi . Tap the switch ON . Select your Wi-Fi network's name. Windows 10/11 Click the network icon in the taskbar, which usually looks like a Wi-Fi fan or similar to the bars you normally see at the top of your cell phone. It may be a globe if you're not currently connected. Click your Wi-Fi network's name. Click Connect . Mac Click the Wi-Fi icon (the fan) in the menu bar. Select your Wi-Fi network. 11. Enter the password. Type the password you created when configuring your Wi-Fi router, and click Connect or similar. Once the password is accepted, your device will be connected to the Wi-Fi access point. 12. Test your internet connection. Once you are connected to the network, wait a moment for your IP address to be assigned. Open a web browser and try to connect to a website you don't normally visit to ensure you aren't loading the website from memory.",
