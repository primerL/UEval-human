    "reference_text": "1. The tags on your clothes tell you the best ways to clean them. Read through the tag on each garment that you’re washing to see what fabric it’s made from and how to clean it properly. Keep similar fabrics together so you can wash them at the same time. Anything that can go in your machine or that has a “hand wash only” label is safe for hand-washing. If a tag says “dry clean only,” then avoid hand-washing that garment to avoid damaging it. As a quick way to check if your garments are safe to hand-wash, place a drop of water on the fabric and blot it up with a paper towel. If the color runs or bleeds, then take it to the dry cleaners. 2. Washing similar garments in the same load prevents colors from running. Sort your laundry so all the light fabrics are separated from the dark ones. Since darker colors could potentially discolor the water, wash the lightest colored clothes first and save the darker ones for last. If you have a new item of clothing that is dyed or colored, wash it separately in a different tub or basin so the color does not get on other clothing. 3. Using a stain remover beforehand makes it easier to wash out. Apply the stain remover directly over the mark on your clothes. Gently dab the stain with your fingers or brush it lightly with a new toothbrush to work the cleaner deeper into the fabric. Let the stain remover sit for about 10–15 minutes before you wash your garment. Test the stain remover in a small inconspicuous spot on your clothes before applying it directly to the stain. 4. A mild detergent meant for delicates cleans clothes more gently. Use your bathtub, sink, or large bowl depending on how many clothes you need to wash. Stick with cool or lukewarm water when you wash your clothes to prevent colors from running. Mix about 1 1 ⁄ 2 fluid ounces (44 ml) of detergent into the water until it’s completely dissolved and forms suds. [5] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Wool and fine knits: Use cold water and wool detergent to keep the fabric soft. Silk or lace: Try a no-rinse detergent to limit how much water comes in contact with the fabric. Alternatively, use mild liquid dish soap if you’re in a pinch. 5. Gently stirring the water is less damaging to clothes than scrubbing. Drop your first load of clothes into the water so they’re submerged. Then, use your hands to gently move the clothes around to wash out the dirt between the fibers. Keep agitating the water for about 2–3 minutes, or until the clothes look clean. Sweaters: Turn sweaters inside-out before washing them to clean them better. Avoid scrubbing, twisting, or rubbing your clothes together when you hand-wash them since you could stretch and damage the fabric. 6. Soaking helps lift dirt and stains deep in the fabric. Leave your clothes submerged for at least 10 minutes so the detergent has time to work through the fabric. If your clothes are really dirty or have stubborn stains, leave them in the water for up to 30 minutes so it’s even more effective. It’s normal for the water to darken as dirt lifts out of the fabric. If the water ever looks really cloudy or dirty, empty it out and refill your container. 7. A thorough rinse removes all the detergent and leftover dirt. Either empty out your container and refill it with clean water, or hold your garments underneath a running faucet. Gently squeeze your clothes as you rinse them until you don’t see any more suds coming out. Alternatively, fill a second container with clean water and transfer your clothes over to rinse them. 8. Gently squeezing your clothes prevents them from stretching. Hold your garments above the water when you squeeze them so you don’t drip. then, lay your garment flat on a towel and slowly roll the towel up to squeeze out even more water. Avoid twisting or wringing out your clothes too forcefully since you’ll stretch or damage the fabric fibers. 9. Drying your clothes flat helps them preserve their shape. While T-shirts and pants are safe to hang dry, delicate fabrics could stretch or distort. When you’re washing sweaters, silks, bras, or lingerie, spread the garments flat so they’re shaped correctly. Keep them in a well-ventilated spot and flip your clothes over after 1–2 hours so the other side can dry. Turn a fan on in the same room as your clothes to help them dry faster. Avoid putting your clothes in the dryer unless the care tag says it’s safe. Otherwise, your clothes may get damaged or shrink.",

    "reference_text": "1. Preheat your oven to 375ºF (190ºC). 2. Grease and line a 9×9 in. (23 x 23 cm.) baking tray about an inch deep. You can also line the pan with aluminum foil, if you like. If you don't have anything to line the tray with, grease the tray with butter and add a light layer of flour over. 3. Melt the butter or margarine in a small pan over low heat. While this is melting, complete the next two steps. It should take about a minute or two for the butter to melt. It'll melt faster if you start off with it at room temperature. 4. Mix the caster sugar and eggs in a separate bowl. Pour the sugar and eggs into a medium-sized bowl and stir the ingredients together until they're fully incorporated. This should take about a minute. You can use a wooden spoon, a whisk, or even an electric mixer to stir the ingredients together. 5. Mix the flour and chocolate powder together in a separate bowl. Now, pour these ingredients into a separate bowl and stir them until they are fully incorporated. 6. Pour the melted butter into the sugar and egg mixture. Then, stir until the butter is well mixed in. This will make a nice, light yellow, creamy mixture. 7. Sift in the cocoa mixture into the egg mixture a little at a time. Just pour the ingredients into a sieve and gently shake it to let the air in while the cocoa mixture falls down into the egg mixture. You can even lightly scrape a fork along the bottom of the sieve to help sift the cocoa mixture. 8. Add the chocolate chips into the mixture. Now, you can mix in the chocolate chips into the rest of the ingredients. You can use regular chocolate chips, or cute mini chips if you prefer that. If you're feeling adventurous and want to mix things up, you can also go for the white chocolate chips. [ citation needed ] 9. Pour the mixture into the baking tray. Now that the tray is greased, it should be all ready for you to pour in the mixture. Use a flat plastic mixer or knife to even out the mixture. It doesn't have to be perfectly even, but try to distribute it around the pan as evenly as you can so that the brownies are of even height throughout. [ citation needed ] 10. Insert the tray on the middle shelf of the oven and bake for 30 minutes. After 25 minutes, keep checking on the brownies to make sure they don't burn. You can even clean up while you're waiting for your brownies to cook. If you hang around the kitchen while the brownies begin to harden, you'll be craving this sweet treat even more! 11. Remove the brownies from the oven and let them cool. Wait at least five minutes for the brownies to cool. This will also give them time to harden a bit. If you cut into them when they're still cooling, it'll be harder to cut them cleanly. 12. Cut the brownies into bite-size chunks. You can cut tiny pieces, so you can devour them in one bite each. You can also cut larger brownies, so each portion is nice and hearty. It's up to you -- if you're making them for a large event, then the smaller, the better. But if you're just cooking for yourself and a few friends or family members, why not cut them to be a little bigger? You can even top them with confectioner's sugar for an extra sweet taste.",

    "question": "How to bake cookies from scratch? Provide a visual guide and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Keep everything cold. If you are using butter in your cookies (and even, to a certain degree, if you aren't) you will want to keep your ingredients refrigerator-cold. This will make your cookies much more firm and keep them from spreading out in the oven. This means that you'll have to warm up the butter enough to work with it by placing it on the counter, rather than in the microwave. Absolutely never melt it in order to mix it into the dough. A great practice is to cool your dough in the fridge for an hour before rolling it out. 2. Always cream butter and sugar. If your recipe calls for butter and doesn't specifically prohibit this practice, you should always \"cream\" the butter and the sugar first. This is a process by which you mix the two until a sort of paste is formed. 3. Try to use salted butter. Sweet cream butter tends to make cookies taste too sweet. The salt will balance out the sweetness of the cookie just enough to make it taste much better over all. You won't be able to properly taste the salt, but believe us, you'll notice the difference. 4. Change the recipe to alter the final product. If you find a recipe that you love the taste of but want a different texture, it is totally possible to alter the recipe just a bit in order to get exactly what you want! Experiment, or try these tricks: Use cake flour instead of regular flour, shortening instead of butter (or for part of the butter), or about 2 teaspoons of cornstarch along with 4 teaspoons less flour in order to get fluffy, cakey, and softer cookies. Use 2 tablespoons of milk, an extra tablespoon or two of butter, or switch your white sugar for brown to get a crispy cookie. Use melted butter to mix dough and then chill it before baking (undercook a minute or two) to get a chewy cookie. You can also use only yolks, instead of whites. Using a rubber spatula often helps speed up the mixing process if you are not using a machine. 5. Weigh your ingredients. If you find that you still struggle with getting your recipe to turn out right, bake like the pros (and Europeans!) do and weigh your ingredients. Get a good electronic kitchen scale and do your recipe based on weight. This will help ensure the perfect cookie. 6. Use an ice cream scoop to make cookies even. If you want to make sure that every cookie in a batch turns out looking the same, use an ice cream scoop to get perfectly equal balls of dough. 7. Use parchment paper. Skip the Silpat in favor of parchment paper. Silpat can make it difficult for cookies to cook evenly and it also keeps the bottoms from developing that perfect crispness. Parchment paper turns out a much better cookie. 8. Bake on the bottom of your cookie sheet. If you notice that the cookies at the edge of your sheet are prone to getting over cooked, use an Round or oval pan. If you don't have one, improvise and flip the pan over to use the bottom! 9. Know your oven. Every oven is different and it is important for you to know how yours behaves. If you know what to expect, then you can find ways to work around the expected problems. For example, if you notice that cookies on one corner or side bake faster than in another, make sure you turn the pan part-way through the baking process. 10. Start with a cold pan. Put your baking sheet in the fridge to cool before you put each set of cookies on. If you want to save time, you can scoop the dough onto parchment paper and store them in the fridge until they are ready to go out on a cooled pan. This means cooling the pan between each set of 12 too! 11. Don't overbake your cookies. If anything it's better to under-bake them. For the first batch carefully watch them and time for when they get the first hint of brown at the edges. Edge browning usually means you've gone too far, though these cookies are still perfectly good (especially if you like yours crispy!). Once you know how long it takes to reach that point, pull them out maybe 30 seconds before they brown for perfectly soft cookies. If you are using white chocolate chips in your cookies, be careful, as they can burn particularly easily. 12. Let cookies sit on the pan. Let your cookies sit on the pan for a few minutes before taking them off. This will let them firm up on the bottom, making them much easier to remove.",

Line a baking sheet with parchment.\n\n2. **Dry mix**\n   Whisk **flour, baking soda, and salt** in a bowl; set aside.\n\n3. **Cream**\n   In a separate bowl, beat **butter + both sugars** on medium until **pale and fluffy (1–2 min)**.\n\n4. **Eggs & vanilla**\n   Beat in **egg, then yolk, then vanilla** just until smooth.\n\n5. **Combine**\n   Add dry ingredients. Mix on low or fold until **just combined** (no dry streaks; avoid overmixing).\n\n6. **Chocolate**\n   Fold in chocolate.\n\n7. **Scoop & (optional) chill**\n   Scoop **2 Tbsp (40–45g)** mounds, well-spaced. For thicker cookies, **chill 15–30 min**.\n\n8. **Bake**\n   Bake **10–12 min** until **edges are set and lightly golden** and **centers still look soft/puffy**.\n\n9. **Set & cool**\n   Cool on the sheet **5 min**, then transfer to a rack. They’ll finish setting as they cool.\n\n## Doneness Cues\n\n* Edges: lightly golden;\n* Centers: soft, a touch pale;\n* Surface: faint cracks with glossy melted chocolate.\n\n## Pro Tips\n\n* **Temperature matters:** butter should be soft but cool (no oily sheen).\n* **Thickness control:** Chill longer for thicker cookies; bake right away for thinner, chewier edges.\n* **Wrinkly tops:** Halfway through baking, **rap** the pan once on the rack.\n\n## Variations\n\n* **Browned-Butter:** Brown 170 g butter; cool till just fluid, then proceed. Adds a nutty note (cookies spread a bit more).\n* **Nutty Crunch:** Add ½ cup toasted chopped pecans or walnuts.\n* **Salted:** Finish with a **pinch of flaky salt** after baking.\n* **Oat-Choc Chip:** Swap 50 g (½ cup) of flour for quick oats.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n* **Too flat:** Butter too warm; dough under-chilled; oven too cool.\n* **Too cakey/dry:** Over-measured flour; overbaked; overmixed.\n* **Greasy edges:** Butter too warm; try chilling 30–60 min.\n\n## Storage & Make-Ahead\n\n* **Baked:** Airtight at room temp **3–4 days**.\n* **Dough balls:** Freeze on a tray, then bag; bake from frozen **12–14 min** at 350°F.\n\n——\n\nI’ll now generate a separate step-by-step visual guide that matches this recipe. 😊\n\n\nIf you’d like the visual saved as a printable PDF or with different colors/sizes, tell me your preference and I’ll regenerate it to match.",

    "question": "How to boil pasta perfectly? Provide a visual guide and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Fill a large pot about 2/3 full of water. Since the pasta needs lots of room to move around as it cooks, use a big pot. For example, if you'll be cooking a 1 pound (450 g) box of pasta, get out a pot that's at least 4 US quarts (3.8 L) in size. Then, pour in enough water to come 2/3 up the side of the pot. If you use a pot that's too small, your pasta is more likely to clump together as it cooks. 2. Cover the pot and bring the water to a boil. Set the pot of water on the stove and put a lid on it. Turn the burner to high and let the water come to a boil. You'll know the water is boiling when you see steam escaping from under the lid. Covering the pot with a lid will make the water boil faster. 3. Add salt and 1 pound (450 g) of pasta to the boiling water. Once the water boils vigorously, remove the lid and add 1 tablespoon (17 g) of salt and 1 pound (450 g) of pasta. If you're cooking long noodles, such as spaghetti, that don't fit in the pot, wait about 30 seconds and then push them into the water using a spoon or pasta fork. The salt will season the noodles as they cook, which will give you flavorful pasta. If you're unsure how many servings of pasta to cook, check the side of the box for recommended serving sizes. 4. Set a timer for 3 to 8 minutes. Stir the noodles with a pasta fork to break the noodles up and leave the lid off the pot. Then, check the pasta package for a recommended cooking time and set a timer for the minimum time that's suggested. For example, if the box says to cook the noodles for 7 to 9 minutes, set a timer for 7 minutes. Thin pasta, such as angel hair, will cook faster than thick or long noodles, such as fettuccine or penne, which take closer to 8 or 9 minutes. 5. Stir the noodles occasionally as they boil. The water should continue to bubble as the pasta cooks. Stir it every few minutes to prevent the noodles from sticking together. If the water looks like it might boil over the sides of the pot, turn the burner down to medium-high. 6. Bite into a noodle to see if it's cooked enough for you. Carefully scoop a noodle out of the water when the timer beeps and set it aside to cool a little. Bite into the noodle to tell if it's still hard in the center or if it's as soft as you like. Most people prefer to cook pasta until it's al dente, which means it's still a little firm in the center. If the pasta is still too hard for your liking, boil it for another minute before checking it again.",

    "generated_text": "Here’s your **text guide**. The **visual guide** is attached above as an infographic.\n\n# Text Guide: How to Boil Pasta Perfectly\n\n1. Pick the pot + water\n\n* Use a big pot so pasta can move freely.\n* Water: **4–6 quarts (4–5.5 L) per 1 lb / 450 g** pasta.\n\n2. Salt like the sea\n\n* Add salt once the water is hot but before the pasta goes in.\n* Aim for **1–2% salinity** (about **1½–2 Tbsp kosher salt** or **1 Tbsp table salt** per 4–6 quarts). This seasons the pasta itself.\n\n3. Rolling boil first\n\n* Wait for a **vigorous, rolling boil (100°C / 212°F)** before adding pasta. Lids help you get there; remove the lid once boiling.\n\n4. Add pasta & stir early\n\n* Drop pasta in and **stir for the first 1–2 minutes** to prevent sticking, then stir occasionally.\n\n5. Cook to al dente (taste, don’t guess)\n\n* Start tasting **2 minutes before** the package’s low end.\n* Al dente = cooked through with a pleasant bite and no chalky center.\n\n6. Save some pasta water\n\n* **Reserve ½–1 cup** starchy water before draining. It helps sauces cling and lets you adjust thickness.\n\n7. Drain, don’t rinse\n\n* **Do not rinse** (you’ll wash off starch). Only rinse if making a **cold pasta salad**.\n\n8. Marry pasta with sauce\n\n* Finish pasta **in a pan with the sauce** for 1–2 minutes, loosening with splashes of reserved water and finishing with a knob of butter or olive oil if desired. Season to taste.\n\n9. Rest & serve hot\n\n* Let it sit **30–60 seconds** off heat to settle the sauce; plate immediately.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Timing Reference (start tasting early!)\n\n* **Fresh pasta (eggs)**: 2–4 min\n* **Dry thin long (spaghetti, linguine)**: 8–10 min\n* **Dry short (penne, rigatoni, fusilli)**: 9–12 min\n* **Thick/shape with ridges or whole wheat**: 11–13+ min\n* **Gluten-free**: often **less forgiving**—taste frequently in the last few minutes.\n\n---\n\n## Common Mistakes & Fixes\n\n* **Pot too small** → water cools off and pasta sticks. Use a larger pot.\n* **Under-salting** → flat flavor. Salt the water properly.\n* **Adding pasta before a full boil** → gummy texture. Wait for the rolling boil.\n* **Not stirring early** → clumps. Stir in the first 1–2 minutes.\n* **Overcooking** → mush. Taste early and often.\n* **Rinsing after draining** → sauce won’t cling. Don’t rinse unless for cold dishes.\n\n---\n\n## Pro Tips\n\n* For silky sauces, emulsify: **toss pasta + sauce + reserved water** over medium heat until glossy.\n* Cooking for later? **Undercook by ~1 minute**, then finish in sauce when reheating.\n* High altitude: water boils at a lower temp—**add a minute or two** and rely on tasting.\n\nIf you want, I can tailor the infographic for a specific pasta shape or serving size.\n",

    "question": "How to Exfoliate Your Body for Soft Skin? Provide a visual guide and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Have a bath or shower. While not part of the exfoliating process per se, immersing your body in hot water will open up your pores, making your skin much more susceptible to cleaning. It also helps to do this process in the bathroom, as you'll need a ready supply of hot water and somewhere to wash away the dead skin flakes once they've been scrubbed off. Use a skin-friendly, perfume-free detergent for bath and allow at least 15 minutes to soften (macerating) the skin surface. It is good when the skin surface looks a bit \"deformed\". Remove \"dead skin\" by rubbing it away with your hands. It will work well, especially at your feet, toes and heels. 2. Get a textured sponge to wash your skin. Tending to your skin with it will help rub away excess skin flakes, leaving your skin softer and cleaner than before. It is recommended you have a sponge ready for use once you have finished up your shower. It should feel slightly rough on your skin, but if it's abrasive to the point of pain, exfoliating wash cloths are a suitable, gentler alternative. Exfoliating can also be done with a rough washcloth. A natural bristle brush makes for a good alternative, particularly while scrubbing the backs of arms or legs. If you're the do-it-yourself type, you might look into making your own loofah from home. 3. Scrub your body gently with your sponge starting from the ankles upward. Scrub the sponge over your skin in small, circular motions. Make sure to apply some pressure to feel the sponge's rough texture on your skin; that way, it will rub the surface-layer dead skin away. Starting at the ankles is recommended because it helps to encourage positive blood circulation during the exfoliation process. healthglamour.com/how-to-exfoliate-the-body/ If you're exfoliating your entire body, make sure to give extra attention to your heels, elbows, and knees. These are generally considered to be the driest parts of one's skin, and should be given greater attention accordingly. 4. Add wet sand or salt to your full body exfoliation. If you've ever walked along the beach barefoot, you may have noticed your foot callouses soften. Sand granules are a naturally occurring exfoliant, and their grainy texture is well-suited to scraping away your excess skin flakes. Salt scrubs do the same thing. You can find sand and salt exfoliating products at any store that sells beauty and skincare products. Be forewarned: Using sand in the bath can cause a bigger mess than more common exfoliants. Although it is recommended to try it out at least once, it may not be the best course of action if you don't have the added time in your routine available to do a bit of cleaning up afterwards. Getting sand down a drain could completely ruin the plumbing pipes if done often. If using sand, it should be cleaned, even bleached, because getting it from outdoors could introduce bacteria and using that to exfoliate would do more harm than good. Choose sand with small granules, not big, because the smaller granules are more gentle on the skin. Focus on the tougher skin of the arms and legs because sand can be more intense than exfoliating scrubs. 5. Rinse with hot water. Closing up shop with a body rinse is a relaxing and effective way to finish your exfoliation. Although it's recommended you repeat this process at least three times a week, you should notice an immediate softness with your skin. Applying a moisturizer or shea butter following your rinse, even following an otherwise purely 'mechanical' cleanse, will help your skin better retain moisture.",

Skip if skin is inflamed.\n* **Chemical (acids/actives):**\n\n  * **AHAs** (lactic, glycolic): dry/dull or uneven texture.\n  * **BHA** (salicylic): body breakouts, clogged pores, ingrowns.\n  * **PHA** (gluconolactone, lactobionic): very sensitive skin.\n  * **Urea** (10–20%): rough bumps/keratosis pilaris (KP).\n\n## 2) Step-by-step routine (shower days)\n\n1. **Soak** in warm (not hot) water for 5–10 min.\n2. **Cleanse** with a gentle, non-stripping body wash.\n3. **Exfoliate**\n\n   * *Physical:* massage with light pressure in small circles for 30–60 sec per area; avoid chest/neck if sensitive.\n   * *Chemical:* apply a thin layer per label. Rinse-off: 1–3 min. Leave-on lotions: use a light, even coat—don’t scrub.\n4. **Rinse & pat dry** (don’t rub).\n5. **Moisturize within 3 minutes.** Look for glycerin, hyaluronic acid, ceramides; for very dry skin, seal with a light oil/occlusive.\n6. **Daytime SPF 30+** on exposed areas (AHAs/BHAs increase sun sensitivity).\n\n## 3) How often?\n\n* **Sensitive:** 1×/week (soft cloth or PHA).\n* **Normal/combination:** 1–2×/week.\n* **Dry/KP-prone:** 2–3×/week (lactic acid or urea, avoid gritty scrubs).\n* **Oily/acne-prone:** 2–3×/week BHA on problem zones (back, chest).\n\n> Signs you’re overdoing it: stinging that lasts, tightness, shiny but fragile skin, more redness or breakouts. Cut back to once weekly.\n\n## 4) Do’s & don’ts\n\n**Do**\n\n* Use gentle pressure; let products do the work.\n* Rinse mitts/cloths after each use; wash weekly; replace loofahs monthly.\n* Exfoliate **before** shaving (same session is OK for gentle physical or mild rinse-off acids).\n* Moisturize every time.\n\n**Don’t**\n\n* Exfoliate on sunburn, open cuts, or active eczema/psoriasis flares.\n* Mix strong actives on the same day (e.g., retinoids + strong acids).\n* Exfoliate right after waxing/laser; wait **48–72 hours**.\n* Use very hot water.\n\n## 5) Targeted tips\n\n* **Ingrown hairs/razor bumps:** Use BHA 0.5–2% the day **before** shaving and again 24–48 h after; shave with slip (gel/cream) in hair-growth direction.\n* **Keratosis pilaris:** Daily urea 10–20% or lactic acid 5–12% lotion; brief gentle physical buffing 2–3×/week; be patient (4–6 weeks).\n* **Feet/elbows/knees:** Can tolerate slightly stronger scrubs—keep separate tools for feet.\n\n## 6) Simple weekly template\n\n* **Mon:** BHA on back/chest after shower → moisturize.\n* **Wed:** Gentle washcloth buff head-to-toe → moisturize.\n* **Fri:** Lactic-acid or urea body lotion (leave-on) at night.\n* **Sun (optional):** Spot-treat rough patches only.\n\n*Friendly reminder:* If you’re pregnant/nursing or on prescription topicals, check product safety first.

    "reference_text": "1. Wash your hands before cleaning your glasses. Wash up for 20 seconds with lotion-free soap and warm water. You’ll need to make sure your hands are free of dirt, grease, and grime before cleaning your glasses. 2. Rinse your glasses with warm water. Run a gentle stream of tap water over your glasses. Rotate them to wet both sides of each lens, the frame, and earpieces. Hot water is bad for lenses, protective coatings, and the frame, so be sure to use warm water. 3. Use your fingertips to carefully lather them with dish soap. Add a small drop of lotion-free dish soap to each lens. Make gentle circular motions with your fingertips to lather the soap over both sides of your lenses, around the frame, and down each earpiece. 4. Clean the nose pads with a cotton swab or soft toothbrush. Use gentle pressure as you scrub the nose pads and the crevices between them and the frame. If you’re using a toothbrush, make sure it’s soft-bristled. Avoid grazing the lenses with the toothbrush, even if it’s soft-bristled. If there’s buildup between the lenses and the frame, use a cotton swab to loosen it. 5. Wash away soap residue. Hold the glasses under running water again to rinse away soap suds. Make sure you’ve washed away all traces of soap, as any remaining residue will cause smudges. 6. Shake off excess water and make sure your lenses are clean. Turn off the water, then give your glasses a careful shake. Check the lenses to make sure they’re clear, and wash them again if you see any smudges. 7. Dry your glasses with a microfiber cloth. Fold a clean microfiber cloth over both sides of a lens. Make soft circular motions with your fingertips to dry it, then repeat on the other lens. Wipe the nose pads, then use the cloth to dry and polish the frame and earpieces. [6] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source 8. Spray your glasses liberally with eyeglass cleaner. Spray cleaners for eyewear are available at pharmacies and eyewear retailers. If you can’t get to a sink and dish soap, spray your glasses with lots of cleaner to flush away dirt and debris. Some eyewear manufacturers and optometrists also offer free samples of spray cleaner. If you have anti-reflective (AR) glasses, make sure the cleaner you use is labelled safe for the AR coating. 9. Wipe away the cleaner with a microfiber cloth. After spraying your glasses, carefully wipe off excess cleaner. Fold the cloth over both sides of each lens, and make gentle circular motions with your fingertips to absorb the cleaner. Then use the cloth to dry the frame and earpieces. 10. Touch up your lenses with disposable eyeglass wet wipes. You can also clean your glasses with wet wipes when you’re on the go. Gently blow on them to remove dust and dirt, then gently rub them with a wet wipe using soft, circular motions. After cleaning them, dry them with a microfiber cloth. Only use wet wipes labelled for cleaning eyewear. If you have AR glasses, make sure your wipes are labelled safe for the AR coating. 11. Clean your glasses every morning and as needed. Make cleaning your glasses part of your morning routine. Check them regularly throughout the day, and touch them up as needed. Keeping your glasses clean and smudge-free will help prevent scratches. 12. Store your glasses in a hard case when you’re not wearing them. Don’t just throw your glasses in your purse or bag, and avoid placing the lenses on hard surfaces. When they’re not in use, keep them in a hard-shell case. The case should fit your glasses; if it’s too big, they might roll around and get damaged. [11] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source 13. Wash your microfiber cloths frequently. Microfiber cloths collect grease and dirt, so you should wash yours after 2 or 3 uses. Some cloths are machine washable, so check the care instructions and launder them as directed. [12] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source If your cloth isn’t machine washable, or if you’re not sure, hand wash it with dish soap, wring it out, then let it air dry. 14. Don’t wipe your glasses with your shirt, tissue, or a paper towel. Shirts, tissues, and paper towels contain fine debris that could scratch your glasses. Additionally, never wipe your glasses when they’re dry, or you’ll risk damaging them. Exhaling on your glasses and wiping them with your shirt might be convenient, but that’s a quick way to scratch up your lenses. Need help keeping your glasses clean?

    "question": "How to change a flat tire safely on the roadside? Provide a visual guide and text the steps. ",
    "reference_text": "1. Find a safe area where traffic won’t be a risk. If you are near a road, park as far from traffic as possible and turn on your emergency hazard lights. Don’t park on an incline to keep your vehicle from rolling away, and stay off of soft soil or grass. If you have to drive slowly for a block or two to get to a safe, flat area, then so be it.Examples of safe areas are as follows: The shoulder of the highway, a public parking lot, or a large space with no pedestrian activity. Apply the parking brake once you’re parked to ensure the vehicle doesn’t move. For added peace of mind, place heavy rocks or blocks around each tire you aren’t changing to keep the vehicle from rolling. 2. The spare will likely be underneath a cover in the trunk. Every make and model will be a little bit different, but your spare should be under the cloth or plastic cover at the bottom of your trunk. Retrieve the wheel from the trunk. Also, remove the jack and the tire iron you need to remove the lug nuts. The tools for completing the change - including the jack, and lug wrench - will be located near the spare tire. On most vehicles, the tire iron is part of the jack. You’ll use it to turn the bolt on the end of the jack to raise or lower it, and also to remove the lug nuts on the tire. If you drive a Jeep or a large SUV, the spare tire may be on the outside or underneath the vehicle. If you don’t have a spare, your vehicle may have a sealant kit to temporarily patch your flat tire . If you don’t have that either, call a tow truck. 3. Move around your vehicle and check for any damaged components or wheels. This article focuses on replacing damaged tires - be sure to contact roadside services in the event you are experiencing any issues you cannot safely handle yourself either due to lack of experience, tools, replacement parts, or severity of the damage. 4. Provided you have the tools necessary, find a solid point on the frame of your vehicle to elevate the portion of the car near the wheel you need to replace. Remember to place the jack in a position that won't be hit by yourself or others, risking the vehicle being dropped from the jack. Elevate the vehicle until the tire is no longer touching the ground (recommended 1-2 inches) Place the jack on a part of the frame that will not damage or warp components of your vehicle, causing more damage. Begin to lift the vehicle by pressing down on the floor jack or by turning the floor jack handle slowly. You will begin to see the tires lift from the ground. To have enough room to dismount the tire, you want to make sure that the tire is at least lifted 3-6 inches from off the ground. Grab your jack stands. These are used as a safety precaution so that the vehicle doesn't fall to the ground in case your floor jacks break or slip. The owner's manual will show you where to place them. To engage the jack stands, use the lever that is attached to them and line it up with the jack stand point (Usually indicated by an arrow engraved into the car) but only raise the stand to about an inch or two away from the jack stand point which is usually the frame of the car. CAREFULLY release the pressure from your floor jack so that the vehicle falls into place with the jack stands 5. Remove the hubcap and loosen the nuts part-way. Start with the lowest bolt and avoid causing damage to the undamaged bolts/lug nuts. Pry the hubcap off using the flat end of your tire iron or a flathead screwdriver. Do not remove the lug nuts entirely. Just use the end of the tire iron to loosen the nuts by turning them counterclockwise so that there’s no longer any resistance. You should be able to spin the nuts by hand, but they shouldn’t be so loose that they spin freely. By keeping the wheel on the ground when you first loosen the nuts, you'll make sure that you're turning the nuts instead of the wheel. Your tire iron may have different sizes of openings on each end. The correct end for the nut will slip easily onto it, but it won’t be so loose that it rattles. If your vehicle doesn’t have a hub cap, don’t worry about that part. If it does, your hub cap may have a center cap that needs to be unscrewed first. On some newer vehicles you need a special “key” to unlock one of the lug nuts as a theft prevention strategy. Look in your glove box and trunk for a special tool that’ll remove that unique lug nut. These lug nuts will have a unique groove inside of them. Use the key to remove the locking lug nut. Keep all bolts as you will be using them to connect your spare tire to your car. 6. Place the divot in the jack directly under the metal rim of the frame. Get on the ground and use the flashlight on your phone to take a closer look. Touch the area directly behind the metal body of your exterior to feel and look for a thin, metal length. This is your frame. Set the jack underneath the frame right next to the tire you’re replacing. Many cars have molded plastic along the bottom. If you don't place the jack in the right spot, it will crack the plastic when you start lifting. If you're not sure about the right place to put the jack, read your owner's manual. There may be a small notch or mark just behind the front wheel wells, or in front of the rear wheel wells where the jack is intended to be placed. 7. Use the jack to raise your tire 4–6 inches (10–15 cm) off of the ground. Turn the handle of the jack clockwise to begin raising the platform up. Once the platform on the jack makes contact with the vehicle, take a look at the point where the jack meets the frame to confirm it’s on your frame. If it isn’t, loosen the jack and reposition it. If it is, continue to lift your vehicle off the ground . The vast majority of jacks are scissor jacks. You use the tire iron or a rod to twist the nut on the side and hoist the vehicle. You might have a pump-assisted jack, though. With a pump jack, you repeatedly move the handle up and down to raise the vehicle hydraulically. This can be kind of freaky the first time you do it. You might think your jack is going to snap or your car is going to tilt over. Don’t worry! Your jack and vehicle are designed to handle this. It can take a few minutes and a lot of elbow grease to get that vehicle up, so feel free to take breaks if you need to. It’s worth double-checking to make sure the jack is on the frame. You really don’t want to damage your vehicle with the jack. Make sure the vehicle is secure in the air by pressing down on the side of the vehicle that is jacked up in the air. Next, you need to add some wheel chalks to the opposite side wheels of the vehicle. If you have the car jacked from the front left side of the vehicle, then you would want to place two wheel-chocks under the rear tires to prevent the vehicle from rolling. 8. Pop the nuts off by hand and pull the tire off. You already loosened the nuts, so removing them should be fairly easy. Use the tire iron and brace the tire with your non-dominant hand if you need to. With all of the lug nuts removed, slide your busted wheel off of the axle and set it aside. Flip your hubcap upside down to turn it into a small bowl and set your lug nuts inside so that you don’t lose them. Use the proper body mechanics when dismounting a tire. Mounting and dismounting a tire is very tiresome and heavy on your back so you always want to make sure you squat using your legs with your back straight. Never place your legs under the vehicle while it's lifted up because that's a safety hazard. If you can, grab a small mechanics chair as this will help secure your back. 9. The side of the spare with the valve stem on it faces out. Line the lug nut bolts up with the openings on the spare and slide the spare on to the axle - holding the tires at the positions of 4 and 8, lifting the tire slightly and pulling the tire out. The valve stem is the little rubber pipe that sticks out where you add air to the tire. If it’s pointed inward towards the body of the vehicle, the tire is backwards. Fun fact, the spare tire is also known as a “donut.” Take one of the bolts you removed from the old tire, take your spare tire, and align the sockets on the tire rim with the sockets on the tire mount, then place the tire on the mount. Insert the bolt into the topmost socket and rotate the bolt into its socket enough to ensure the tire will not fall off the mount, but not too tightly as to fully insert the bolt into the socket. Grab the tire using proper body mechanics (this is important for your physical health) by getting down on one knee and rolling the tire onto your foot. Carefully lift with your arms and foot to align the tire with the hub. Align the tire with the wheel hub. Press the tire and wheel against the hub so that it sits completely flushed and symmetrical with the hub bearing (this is important for tightening reasons). Keep your foot pressed onto the tire to secure it. Begin screwing the lug nuts back on. First, you want to make sure that you're hub cap is securely placed back on. Start with one lug nut and thread it all the way down on the wheel stud to help hold the tire on the hub. 10. Don’t tighten the nuts using the tire iron just yet. Gently slide each over the bolt and tighten it by hand to partially lock them in place. You will tighten the lug nuts again once the car is down and there is no risk of it falling. Just to clarify, use the same lug nuts that were previously on your wheel. You don’t need special lug nuts for the spare. 11. With the wheel on the axle, lower the jack and remove it. Turn the handle or bolt on the jack counterclockwise to begin lowering the vehicle. Continue lowering the vehicle until the tire is comfortably back on the ground. Then, carefully remove the jack from underneath and set it back in your trunk. [8] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Keep your entire body out from underneath the vehicle. If the jack slips your vehicle gets closer to the ground, you don’t want your body underneath it. 12. Completely tighten the nuts until they won’t turn any further. Using the tire iron, tighten each nuts 3-4 times and then move on to the lug nut on the opposite side. Work in a star pattern to ensure the nuts are secured in an even pattern. Continue tightening the nuts in a cycle until all of the lug nuts are completely secure. [9] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source After you’ve tightened each nut, try to tighten each nut one more time to ensure they’re as tight as they can possibly get. Put your busted tire in the trunk alongside the jack and tire iron. 13. Remove and release all of the jacks from the car. Start off by lifting the vehicle up from the jack stands by using the floor jacks. Do this to make sure you are able to remove the jack stands. Remove the jack stands from under the vehicle. Remove the old tire and wheel assembly. Release the pressure from the floor jack by slowly turning the lever to the left and you will start to see the vehicle slowly fall to the ground. Once the vehicle is fully on the ground. Remove the floor jack. Remove wheel chocks. 14. Keep your speed under 50 miles per hour (80 km/h) and don't go further than 50 miles (80 km). If your spare is a full-size tire (rather than a donut), you can drive the same way you normally would. Check your tire pressure and fill your spare with air as needed. This is especially important if the spare has been in your trunk for a while, since it may have leaked a little in storage. [10] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Head to an auto shop as soon as you can. Small punctures can usually be repaired for $15-100. If the tire is not repairable, you may need to buy a replacement tire.",

Put on a **reflective vest** if you have one.\n* Set the **parking brake** (and put the car in Park; manual: 1st gear or Reverse).\n* Place **wheel chocks**/big stones **on both sides** of a tire opposite the flat (e.g., if front-left is flat, chock the right-rear).\n* Get people and pets away from the traffic side. Never crawl under the vehicle.\n\n## Tools you’ll need\n\n* Spare tire (compact “donut” or full-size)\n* Jack and **owner’s-manual jack point locations**\n* Lug wrench (and locking-lug key if you have one)\n* Wheel chocks, gloves, flashlight, and warning triangle/cones (if available)\n\n## Step-by-step\n\n1. **Prep the area**\n   Place a warning triangle 100–200 ft (30–60 m) behind the car if safe to do so.\n\n2. **Expose the lugs**\n   Remove the hubcap/wheel cover if present.\n\n3. **Break the lug nuts loose**\n   With the wheel **still on the ground**, use the lug wrench to loosen each nut about ½–1 turn. Push down with your foot if needed; don’t fully remove them yet.\n\n4. **Position the jack at the correct jack point**\n   Check your manual for the reinforced spot near the flat tire. Never jack on plastic trim or thin metal.\n\n5. **Lift the vehicle**\n   Raise until the flat tire just clears the ground by an inch or two (2–5 cm). Keep your body and limbs out from under the car.\n\n6. **Remove the flat wheel**\n   Spin off the loosened lug nuts and set them in a safe spot (a hubcap works). Pull the wheel straight off the hub.\n\n7. **Mount the spare**\n   Line up the holes with the studs; slide the wheel fully onto the hub. Thread the lug nuts **by hand** until snug.\n\n8. **Initial tighten in a star pattern**\n   Using the wrench, snug the nuts in a **star/ criss-cross** sequence—do not fully torque yet.\n\n9. **Lower the vehicle and final tighten**\n   Lower the car until the tire just contacts the ground and the jack is free. Now fully tighten the nuts in the **same star pattern** until firmly secure. (Later, torque to your vehicle’s spec.)\n\n10. **Stow and check**\n    Put the flat and tools away, remove chocks/triangle, and check the spare’s pressure. For compact spares, **observe the sidewall limits** (often around 50 mph / 80 km/h and short distances). Drive to a tire shop for repair or replacement **as soon as possible**.\n\n## Extra tips\n\n* If a nut won’t budge, apply steady pressure rather than jerky motions; a short pipe over the wrench handle can help (carefully).\n* If the jack sinks on soft ground, place a solid board under it.\n* After 5–10 miles (8–16 km), **re-check lug nut tightness**.\n* If you have **TPMS**, the warning light may stay on until the repaired tire is back on.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can also turn these steps into a printable one-page checklist or add car-specific jack points based on your make/model.\n",

    "question": "How to organize your closet? Provide illustrated steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Remove all of the clothes from your closet. Take all of your clothes off their hangers and out of any bins or drawers in your closet. Fold them in piles on the floor or on your bed. This includes your shoes as well. It may also include other accessories such as belts, scarves, purses, or ties. 2. Decide which clothes you will keep. You may have the urge to keep everything, or toss everything. But go through systematically and piece by piece to really scrutinize your clothing. What you want in your closet are clothes that you wear on a regular basis, that fit you and are functional, and fit in the space available. Does the item fit? Clothing in the closet should fit you properly, neither too loose nor too tight. It typically means it is comfortable, not pinching, clothing can button easily, and no red marks left on the skin. It may also mean letting go of items no longer in fashion, such as skin tight skirts you really should not wear to your professional job. It is usually best to let go of \"inspirational items\" such as the jeans you hope to someday fit back into; trends being what they are the item may well be out of fashion when you do lose the weight. One pair of \"fat pants\" may be OK to remind you of your weight loss accomplishment. If your weight is fluctuating up or down (such as in growing young adults, pregnant women, or dieters) this may be tricky. Still, get rid or store items that clearly do not fit you. Do I wear this? Have you worn the item in the last year? How often do you wear it: once a week or only once this year? If you have not worn the item in a long time, that may well indicate it is time to let go. Special use items may be OK to keep even if used only periodically. You might have a Christmas sweater, or interview outfit, or formal dress that isn't used often but still worth having available. Do I like this? If you really don't like an item, do not keep it. In general, do not hang onto items out of guilt--such as that shirt your father bought you but you just do not like. Do I have multiples of this? Work or school uniforms are one thing. But if you have seven black almost identical t-shirts, that might be a sign to let go of a few. Make a \"Keep\" pile for the clothes that you will keep and wear on a regular basis. 3. Decide which clothes you will store. You should store the clothes that you won't be wearing for a while because they aren't seasonally appropriate. If it's the middle of summer, you can store your winter sweaters and scarves, and if it's the dead of winter, you can store your tank tops and summer dresses. You can also store clothes that may have sentimental value for you, such as a shirt your grandmother knitted for you, or an old t-shirt from your high school tennis team that no longer fits. Try to keep the sentimental value clothes to a minimum, though. Clothes are meant to be worn, after all. Consider displaying beloved clothing instead of keeping them in your closet. Consider framing your prized concert T-shirt, or creating a shadow box of your Boy Scout uniform and awards, or make a T-shirt quilt of your old marathon shirts. When you're done sorting through the clothes you will store, put them in a plastic bin or a clear bag marked keep. You can either store them in the back of your closet, under your bed, or in a storage unit or a different part of your home if you have the room. 4. Decide which clothes you will donate or throw out. This is the hardest step, and the most important. If you want to have a truly organized closet, then your goal should be to get rid of as many items of clothing as possible. This doesn't mean you should throw out your favorite things - however, it does mean that you should take a long hard look to ask yourself which clothes you will actually ever wear again. If you haven't worn something in over a year and it has no sentimental value, it's time to donate it. If you have an item that is so worn, covered in moth holes, or faded that you and anyone else will never wear it again, then it's time to throw it out. If you have a few items of clothing that are just way too small, stop waiting for the day that they will fit and donate them. Donate all of the clothes you don't need that are in good condition, or give them to a sibling or friend. 5. Clean the inside of the closet. You should do this before you put back your clothes. Vacuum or sweep the floor, wipe the walls down with all-purpose cleaner, and sweep away any cobwebs that may have accumulated there. If you want to make any changes, such as painting the inside a different color or adding and removing some shelves, do it now. 6. Hang up your clothes and organize them. Try to hang up as many of your clothes as you can. This will make it easier for you to find your clothes and to conserve space. You should not only hang up your clothes, but you should also organize them in a particular way so you can easily find them whenever you need to. Here are some ways to organize the clothes you hang up: Organize your clothes by season. If you've stored away some of your seasonal clothes, organize your clothes by season just for half the year. If it's summer, hang up your summer clothes first, followed by your fall clothes. Organize your clothes by type. You can separate your tank tops, shirts, pants, skirts, and dresses. Organize your work and casual clothes. Separate your work clothes from your casual clothes so you can easily get dressed for work in the morning. Organize your clothes by how often you wear them. You can choose any method of organization, but hang up a few key items, like your favorite hoodie or the pair of jeans you wear all the time, in the most accessible place. If you really want to step it up a notch, you can use differently colored hangers to mark a different type of clothing. For example, you can hang your tops on pink hangers, or your work clothes on green hangers. Colour code your clothes. example in rainbow colours You can also think about installing another pole to hang up your additional clothes. 7. Put additional clothes in other parts of your closet. Once you've hung up all of the clothes fit on your pole, you should find other parts of the closet to store the rest of your clothes. The clothes that you put in the bins should be used less frequently than the clothes you hang up, or they should be clothes that don't need to be hung up, like your workout clothes. Here are a few ideas: Don't waste the space under your hanging clothes. Put a few plastic bins of clothes under the hanging clothing. If you have room for a dresser, consider putting one in your closet. It will save you time and space. Consider installing a closet organizer to find a more efficient way to store your remaining clothes . If you have overhead space, make the most of it. Use it to store bulky sweaters, sweats, and other items that are thick and easy to spot. 8. Organize your shoes. Your shoes may take up a lot of the space in your closet, so once you've chosen which shoes you will keep, it's important to make the most of your space by storing them in the most organized and efficient manner. Here are some ways to organize the shoes in your closet: Organize them by type. Separate your dress shoes, sandals, and boots. Organize them by how often you wear them. Keep your favorite pair of boots, flip-flops, or sneakers in the place with the easiest access. Invest in a shoe rack to place on the floor of your closet. This will make it much easier to find the pair of shoes you want. Try storing your shoes in your overhead space. This is another easy way to save space. If your closet has a door that opens instead of a sliding door, consider getting a hanging shoe rack. If you have a front hall closet, consider putting the shoes you wear the most often there instead to save space in your personal closet. 9. Organize any boxes in your closet. If your closet is big enough, then it's likely that you've stored things other than clothes in it, such as big boxes filled with mementos, old photo albums, and CDs you haven't seen for ten years. To finish organizing your closet, you should go through these old boxes to see what you should keep and what you should toss. Here's how to do it: Get rid of any papers or items you've kept for over a year that have no sentimental value. Consolidate the boxes to save closet space. If your closet is already cramped, consider putting some of the items in a different place, such as putting your old high school yearbooks on the bottom of your bookshelf. If you've been using cardboard boxes, trade them up for plastic bins. They will last longer and will be more visually appealing. Label the boxes or bins so you know what's in them next time you move or organize your things again. 10. Organize any additional items in your closet. Take the time to go through any additional items in your closet to make sure that you still need them and that the closet is really the best place for them. Here are some examples: If you find any towels, sheets, or blankets, put them in your linen closet. If you've had an old lawn chair or another piece of furniture you don't really need hanging out back there, it's time to throw it out. If you've had to pick up an item and spend at least fifteen seconds trying to figure out what the heck it is or why you would need it, it's time to throw it out. Make sure that all of the other items you find belong in the closet and not another part of your home. For example, if you find a box of light bulbs, a box of comic books, or a box of chocolate, ask yourself if those items wouldn't be more logically organized elsewhere. 11. Make your closet more visually appealing. Turn your creativity loose and think of ways to add pleasure to the routine of getting dressed and looking through your closet every day. If you spend more time making your closet look nice, then you will be less likely to let it get messy in the future. Paint your closet a soft pretty color. Add mirrors for sparkle. Hang jewelry and scarves where you can see them -- as long as they don't get in your way. Hang up a small poster or painting that makes you smile every time you open your closet. 12. Enjoy your newly organized closet. Take a step back and admire your hard work! Hopefully, your closet is organized now so that all of its contents are easy to find and its overall appearance is to your liking. If not, take a few more minutes to make any minor changes that still need to be made. From this point forward, try to keep your closet organized as you add to it, or remove and return its current contents. Doing so will prevent you from needing to do another large overhaul on your closet in the future.",

As you go, drop items into: Keep / Donate / Tailor-Fix / Trash / Seasonal. Keep sentimental items in a separate small box.\n\n2. **Declutter Fast**\n   For each item ask: *Do I wear it? Does it fit? Do I love it?* If it fails 2+ questions, let it go. Put donations straight into your car or schedule a pickup.\n\n3. **Measure & Plan Zones**\n   Measure width, height to shelf, and depth. Sketch zones: **Long hang**, **Short hang (double rod if possible)**, **Shelves/Drawers**, **Shoes**, **Accessories**.\n\n4. **Choose the Right Tools**\n\n   * Hangers: one style for tops/bottoms, sturdy for coats.\n   * Shelves: add dividers for stacks.\n   * Bins: clear or labeled for accessories and off-season.\n   * Over-the-door/side-wall hooks for bags, hats, scarves.\n\n5. **Group by Category**\n   Tops → Bottoms → Dresses → Outerwear → Activewear → Accessories → Shoes.

File-fold tees in drawers.\n\n7. **Use Vertical Space**\n   Add a second rod for short items, under-shelf baskets, and stackable boxes on the top shelf. Use floor space for a shoe rack; store rarely used items highest.\n\n8. **Label & Maintain**\n   Label shelves and bins (e.g., “Sweaters,” “Gym,” “Bags”). Do a 5-minute tidy each week; do a seasonal swap twice a year.\n\n## Quick Layout Tips\n\n* **Tiny reach-in:** Double-rod 2/3 of the width; one narrow long-hang section; over-door hooks; under-bed box for off-season.\n* **Standard reach-in:** One long-hang, one double-hang, one shelf stack with dividers; 2–3 clear bins up top.\n* **Walk-in:** U-shape: long-hang on the shortest wall, double-hang on others; drawers/shelves in the center; island only if walk path remains ≥ 36\".\n\n## Maintenance Mini-Routine (10 minutes)\n\n* Return strays, re-fold one stack, re-set hangers to face forward, toss one item you won’t wear, and empty donation bag when it fills.\n\n---\n\n**Image:** I’ve generated an illustrated “Closet Organization in 8 Steps” poster separately for you to use alongside these instructions.",

    "question": "How to clean a cutting board? Provide steps with visuals and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Rinse your board right after using it. Rinse your board with water right after you use it, rather than waiting until the end of the meal or even the next day when you clean it. This will help minimize bacteria growth and keep your board cleaner. Resist the urge to throw your board in the sink after the meal and forget about it. 2. Clean your board with dish soap and hot water. To clean your cutting board, scrub it with a few drops of dish soap on a sponge and some hot water. [2] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview Be sure to remove any food particles as you wash, paying particular attention to any grooves or scrapes in your board. Food can collect in these spots. Never clean a wooden cutting board in the dishwasher or soak it in water. The wood will absorb water, which can lead to bacteria and mold forming. [4] X Expert Source James Sears House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview 3. Rinse your board. Rinse your board to remove any traces of soap. You don’t want whatever you cook next to taste like your dish soap. [5] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview 4. Dry your board thoroughly to prevent cracking. After you’re finished washing your cutting board, dry it thoroughly with a clean dishtowel, removing any excess water. This is particularly important if your board is made of wood, as they are more prone to cracks. 5. Use a combination of white vinegar and baking soda. To sanitize your cutting board after use, sprinkle it with some baking soda. Then, spray the baking soda–covered board with white vinegar. This will fizz, helping draw stains out of your board and deodorizing it. Let this mix sit for 5 minutes and then rinse your board with water, drying as normal. 6. Disinfect your board with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Just as hydrogen peroxide can clean a wound, it can also clean your cutting board. Sprinkle your board with 3% hydrogen peroxide solution, and let it stand for 1 minute to kill any surface bacteria. Then, rinse your board with water, and dry with a dishtowel as normal. [8] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview Hydrogen peroxide can bleach porous surfaces like wood. Don’t let the solution sit too long or it might fade your cutting board. 7. Remove stains with a scrub of coarse salt. For deep, set-in stains on your cutting board, use a coarse salt, such as kosher salt, as a scrub. [10] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview Wet a sponge and use a handful of salt to scour your board, focusing on any areas of discoloration. Rinse your board with water when finished, and dry with a clean towel. [11] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview Be sure to wash your hands well and moisturize them with lotion after scrubbing your board with salt. It can be very drying. Another option is wearing kitchen gloves. 8. Wash your board with diluted bleach once a month. Especially if you work with raw meats and fish on your cutting board, use a diluted bleach solution to do a deep clean of your board once a month. Make a solution that’s 1/8th bleach and 7/8ths water. Wet a sponge, and scrub your board with the solution. Rinse well with plain water and dry your board as normal with a clean towel. 9. Rub your board with a lemon to deodorize once a week. To keep your board smelling fresh, use half of a cut lemon to deodorize your board. Rub the cut-side of the lemon along the length of the board side to side. Then, rinse with plain water, and dry with a clean towel. 10. Condition your cutting board weekly. If your cutting board is made of wood, use mineral oil to condition your board after it’s clean. This will keep it in optimal condition. Do not use organic oils or fats, which can turn rancid, to lubricate your board. Look for products labeled kitchen-grade white mineral oil, such as Howard’s Cutting Board Oil. There are other mineral oils meant for lubricating machinery but not for consumption. Look specifically for kitchen-grade oil. You can condition your board every time you clean it, or a minimum of once a week. Simply rub your board with the conditioner, and let it air try so the oil can soak in.",

    "generated_text": "# How to Slice a Pineapple (text guide)\n\n**You’ll need:** ripe pineapple, large chef’s knife, sturdy cutting board, optional paring knife or small round cutter, towel.\n\n1. **Prep & safety**\n\n* Rinse the pineapple. Place a damp towel under the board so it won’t slip.\n\n2. **Remove crown & base**\n\n* Lay the pineapple on its side. Slice off about ½ inch from the top (crown) and bottom to make flat ends.\n\n3. **Stand and peel**\n\n* Stand it upright. Following the curve of the fruit, slice downward in long strips to remove the skin. Keep cuts shallow to save fruit.\n\n4. **Remove the “eyes”**\n\n* You’ll see brown “eyes” left in diagonal rows. Make shallow V-shaped notches along those diagonals (or shave them off) until the flesh is clean.\n\n5. **Choose your cut**\n\n* **Method A — Rings:** Lay the pineapple on its side and slice crosswise into ½-inch discs. Use a small round cutter or a paring knife to remove the hard core circle from each disc.\n* **Method B — Spears & Chunks:** Stand it up. Cut in half lengthwise, then into quarters. Lay each quarter flat and slice off the tough core (a pale, fibrous triangle) from the center edge. Cut quarters into long spears, then into bite-size chunks.\n\n6. **Serve or store**\n\n* Eat right away, or refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 3–4 days. For longer storage, freeze chunks on a tray, then bag.\n\n**Tips**\n\n* A ripe pineapple smells sweet at the base and yields slightly when pressed.\n* For cleaner cuts, wipe juice from the board as you go.\n* Try a sprinkle of lime and chili powder, or grill spears 1–2 minutes per side for caramelization.\n\n(Visual guide generated separately above.)\n",

    "reference_text": "1. A mild cleanser cleans skin gently without irritation. No matter what skin type you have, for daily cleansing, pick a face wash that’s fragrance- and alcohol-free. Using cleansers that are too harsh can strip your skin of its natural oils, leading to breakouts and dry skin. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source First, figure out what skin type you have , then check out our cleanser recommendations below: For oily or acne-prone skin: Oil-free cleanser (that won’t clog pores) [2] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source For dry skin: Hydrating cleanser (to moisturize while you wash) For combination or normal skin: Gentle foaming cleanser (to cleanse dirt and grime gently) For sensitive skin: Fragrance-free cleanser (to avoid irritating skin) For aging skin: Gentle cleanser (to cleanse dirt and grime without drying) 2. Take off your makeup to avoid clogged pores. Face cleansers are meant to cleanse your skin, not remove makeup. If you like to wear makeup during the day, use a gentle makeup remover on a cotton pad to take everything off before washing your face. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you have acne-prone or oily skin, go for a water-based makeup remover (instead of an oil-based one) to avoid clogged pores. 3. Use lukewarm water to gently wet your skin. Hot water strips your skin of its natural oils, and cold water doesn’t remove dirt and grime effectively. Turn your tap to a temperature that’s just above room temp, then splash your face with water. If you have long hair, pull it back into a bun or ponytail before you start washing your face. This will make it much easier to cleanse your skin. 4. Gently apply face wash to your skin in a circular motion. Pour a coin-sized amount of cleanser onto your hands, then rub your palms together to lather it up. Rub the cleanser all over your face, including your cheeks, nose, forehead, chin, and jawline for about 10 seconds. Using a washcloth or a cleansing device to wash your face might sound like a good idea, but actually, they can be too harsh on your skin. For daily cleansing, just use your hands. Don’t use cleanser around your eyes. The skin there is so delicate that it rarely needs cleansing—just splashing the area with water will do. 5. Be gentle with your skin as you rinse and dry to avoid irritation. Use lukewarm water again, and splash it onto your face to rinse off the cleanser. Grab a clean towel and pat your skin dry, trying not to rub or scrub your face. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Rubbing your skin with a towel can be irritating, which can lead to dry skin or acne breakouts. Be sure to dry your skin with a clean towel. Using a dirty towel can introduce bacteria into your skin, which can lead to clogged pores. 6. Use toner to tackle red marks or dark spots. Using a toner is totally optional, and not everyone needs one in their skincare routine. However, using a toner can help smooth out your skin tone and complexion. To add a toner to your skincare routine, pour a pea-sized amount onto a cotton swab and gently rub it into your skin right after cleansing. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For oily or acne-prone skin: Cleansing toner (to prevent breakouts) For dry skin: Hydrating toner (to moisturize throughout the day) For combination or normal skin: Toner with witch hazel and aloe (to smooth skin and close the pores) For sensitive skin: Soothing toner (for hydration without irritation) For aging skin: Toner with vitamin C (to hydrate and plump skin) If you use serums, acne cream, or other products on your skin, now is the time to apply those as well. 7. Apply moisturizer to lock in hydration after cleansing. Washing your face is very drying, and all skin types need some moisture afterward. Find a moisturizer that’s for your skin type, then rub moisturizer all over your skin with your fingertips. [8] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source For oily or acne-prone skin: Hydrating gel [9] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source For dry skin: Thick salve or ointment For combination or normal skin: Moisturizing lotion For sensitive skin: Fragrance-free moisturizer For aging skin: Cream-based moisturizer [10] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source 8. Cleanse your skin in the morning and at night to keep it clean. Experts recommend washing your face 2 times per day, or after you sweat. This will help keep your skin clean and avoid oil-buildup and breakouts. [11] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Overwashing your face can be just as damaging as not washing it enough. Although it might seem like a good idea to cleanse your skin more often throughout the day, your face needs its natural oils to function. Try to stick to washing once in the morning and once at night for the best results. If you feel like your skin needs a refresh during the day, splash it with lukewarm water and then pat your face dry. This will help wipe away any excess oil or grime on your skin. Don’t feel like you need to include a whole slew of products in order to have a great routine. Try adding in products one at a time to figure out what works best for you! Reader Poll: We asked 871 wikiHow readers about what products make up their daily skincare routine, and 56% of them shared that they use just water and maybe one product . [Take Poll] 9. Exfoliating removes dead skin cells and opens up your pores. Over-exfoliating can be drying and can lead to breakouts, so try to exfoliate instead of washing your face no more than once a week. To exfoliate, wet your skin with lukewarm water, then gently rub a chemical exfoliant or a physical exfoliant onto your skin. Rinse your skin with lukewarm water, pat it dry, then follow up with a moisturizer. [12] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Chemical exfoliants are better for dry or sensitive skin, and physical exfoliants are better for normal or oily skin. Exfoliating is very drying, so always follow up with a moisturizer afterwards. 10. Use sunscreen to prevent dark marks and hyperpigmentation. An important part of your skin care routine is using SPF 30 or higher sunscreen every day. Apply it after your moisturizer and before your makeup (if you wear it) to protect against UV rays when you head outside. Make sure to reapply your sunscreen every 2 hours, or as often as the bottle tells you to. If you have oily skin, look for an oil-free sunscreen to avoid clogged pores or breakouts. For all other skin types, look for a sunscreen that’s formulated for your face. Remember, UV rays are always there, even on cloudy days! Sunscreen will protect your skin even when you can’t see the sun.",

Imagine the other loose end of the string, which you're holding in your right hand, is the \"rabbit\". The rabbit comes up the hole, runs around the tree, and goes back down the hole. Another way to remember how to make this knot is with a rhyme: \"Lay the bight to make a hole Then under the back and around the pole Over the top and through the eye Clinch it tight and let it lie\" 2. Hold one end of the rope in your left hand. This will be your ‘standing end’ or the end that does not move (consider this end the ‘hole’ and the ‘tree’.) Hold the other end in your right hand (this is the free end--the end of the rope that will be used to form the knot, or the ‘rabbit.’)Make a small loop with the end of the string in your left hand.

You can wash removable parts of your coffee maker the same way you would wash dishes. Glass pots can be very breakable. When washing your coffee maker's pot, treat the glass gingerly. Some coffee makers may have parts that can be washed in a dishwasher. Check the instructions manual, if you still have it. If you're unsure if your coffee maker can be washed in the dishwasher, err on the side of caution and hand wash it. 3. Wipe down the outside of the machine. Take a wet, soapy rag and give the outside of the machine a good wipe down. Wipe down the sides and remove any coffee grinds from the warming plate. When you're down, wipe off any soap suds with a clean, damp rag. 4. Reassemble your machine. After all the parts are dry, you can put your coffee machine back together. It is ready to use again. Make a habit of cleaning your coffee maker like this after each use. 5. Add a vinegar and water solution to your coffee maker.

[5] X Expert Source Marcus Shields House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview The precise amounts will vary depending on the size of your coffee maker, but make roughly enough to fill the reservoir. Pour the mixture into the reservoir like you normally would with water when making coffee. 6. Let the coffee machine run half a brew cycle. [7] X Expert Source Jonathan Tavarez Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview Turn the coffee machine on. Keep an eye on it as it brews. Once about half the pot is full with the filtered vinegar/water mixture, turn the pot off. 7. Let the coffee maker sit for an hour. Set a timer for an hour. Let the coffee pot sit for this time frame. This will give the vinegar time to sit in the machine and clean out any mold. 8. Complete the brew cycle. After letting the coffee maker sit for an hour, turn the machine back on. Let it run the rest of the brew cycle. [10] X Expert Source Jonathan Tavarez Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview When done, all the vinegar/water mixture should be filtered into the pot. You can pour this mixture down the sink. 9. Run three brew cycles with plain water. Fill your coffee pot with clean water. Pour this into the reservoir and run a complete brew cycle. [12] X Expert Source Jonathan Tavarez Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview When it's done, pour the water out and run two more brew cycles with clean water. This should clean any vinegar out of your coffee maker. 10. Wipe down the coffee maker. After disinfecting the coffee maker, take a clean, damp rag. Wipe down the exterior of the machine to remove any dirt and debris. You should also make sure to remove coffee grinds from the warming plate. 11. Read your instruction's manual. If you still have the instructions manual, read it before cleaning your coffee maker. Most coffee makers can safely be cleaned with a vinegar/water mixture, but it's always a good idea to check first.

You may be able to find an instructions manual on the Internet. 12. Leave the reservoir lid open. Many people keep the reservoir lid closed. However, it's a good idea to leave it open when not in use. This will help dry out the machine, preventing mold and bacteria from growing in a moist environment. 13. Rinse the brew basket in the sink regularly. The brew basket is very susceptible to mold as it gets wet during the brewing process. Make sure you rinse out the brew basket after each use and make a habit of cleaning it each time you do dishes. This will keep your coffee maker mold and germ free.

    "generated_text": "# Text-only steps (for a standard drip coffee maker)\n\n## Before you start\n\n* Unplug the machine and let it cool.\n* Check your manual; some brands discourage vinegar—use citric acid instead if so.\n* Remove any charcoal/water filter from the reservoir (replace after cleaning).\n\n## Quick clean (after each brew)\n\n1. Discard grounds and the paper filter.\n2. Wash the carafe, brew basket, lid, and reusable mesh filter in warm, soapy water; rinse and air-dry.\n3. Wipe the exterior and warming plate with a damp cloth; leave the lid open to dry.\n\n## Deep clean & descale (every 1–3 months, or ~every 40 brews)\n\n1. **Empty & prep:** Reassemble the empty basket; place the empty carafe on the plate.\n2. **Mix descaler:**\n\n   * Option A: Fill the reservoir with a **1:1 mix of white vinegar and water**.\n   * Option B (vinegar-free): **1–2 tsp citric acid per cup (250 mL) of warm water**, stir to dissolve, then fill the reservoir.\n3. **Start brew & soak:** Run a brew cycle until the carafe is **about halfway** full, then **pause** the machine for **30 minutes** to dissolve mineral buildup.\n4. **Finish brew:** Resume and complete the cycle; discard the hot solution carefully.\n5. **Rinse cycles:** Fill the reservoir with plain water and run **2–3 full cycles**, discarding each carafe, until there’s **no vinegar/citric smell**.\n6. **Detail clean:**\n\n   * Wipe the showerhead/spray arm and the area under the brew basket; use a soft brush or toothpick to clear clogged holes.\n   * Clean the carafe stains with a paste of **baking soda + a few drops of water**; rinse thoroughly.\n7. **Reinstall filter:** If you use a charcoal water filter, install a fresh one.\n\n## Safety & tips\n\n* **Never use bleach** or abrasive scrubbers inside the machine.\n* Hard water? Descale **monthly**; soft water can go **every 2–3 months**.\n* For **single-serve pod machines**, run a “brew” with no pod using the same descaling mix, then 2–3 water-only brews; also clean the pod needle with the manufacturer’s tool or a paperclip.\n\nIf you’d like, I can also generate a second illustration specifically for single-serve machines or espresso makers.\n",
