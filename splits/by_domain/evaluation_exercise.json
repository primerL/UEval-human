    "reference_text": "1. Lie on your back on top of an exercise mat . Find a comfortable spot to lie down on the floor where you can spread out. Keep your neck and back in line. Tighten your abs and push your lower back flat against the mat the entire time you’re performing crunches to ensure your core stays engaged. If you don’t have an exercise mat, then lay out a soft towel or do crunches on a carpeted floor so you’re more comfortable. 2. Bend your knees so your feet are flat on the floor. Position your feet so your heels are about 12 to 18 in (30 to 46 cm) from your tailbone. Bend your knees to 90 degrees and keep them about hip-width apart. Make sure the soles of your feet are flat against the ground. 3. Cross your arms in front of your chest with your hands just below your shoulders. Keep your elbows pointed down toward your feet. Lay your hands flat on your chest right in front of your shoulders. Avoid putting your hands behind your head since you could accidentally strain your neck when you perform your exercise. For more resistance during your workout, hold a 5 to 10 pounds (2.3 to 4.5 kg) plate weight over your chest. 4. Lift your shoulder blades off of the mat with a smooth, controlled motion. Tighten your abs and take a deep breath in. As you exhale, engage your muscles to raise your torso off of the mat all while keeping your lower back and feet flat on the floor. Lift yourself just enough to get your shoulder blades off of the floor. Support yourself in this position for 1–2 seconds. Avoid sitting all the way up when you perform a crunch since muscles in your back and hips will take over, and you could strain yourself. Keep your lower back, tailbone, and feet in contact with the mat at all times. If your feet lift off of the ground while you’re performing a rep, have someone hold onto your feet or position them underneath something heavy. Keep your neck relaxed instead of tucking in your chin. Try to keep an apple-sized space between your chin and your chest. Looking at the ceiling can help keep you from curling your neck too much. 5. Lower yourself back down with a slow, steady motion. Gently inhale as you slowly lower your torso down to the floor. Use a smooth, controlled motion to work your ab muscles and prevent you from injuring yourself. Take a brief pause to finish 1 rep. If you rush into the next rep, you’ll end up using the momentum of your body moving instead of your muscles to lift yourself up. Additionally, you’re more likely to injure your back Try doing a set of 10–12 crunches to start working out your abs . As you start building up your core strength, try doing 2–3 sets or increasing the number of reps you do.",

Set up\n\n* Lie on your **right side** on a mat.\n* Bend knees about **90°** and stack hips, knees, and ankles.\n* Right forearm on the floor for balance; **left hand** lightly behind your head (don’t pull your neck).\n* Keep ribs “down” and neck neutral.\n\n2. Brace\n\n* Take a breath in.\n* Gently **brace your core** as if preparing for a light poke, keeping hips stacked and elbow open.\n\n3. Crunch up\n\n* **Exhale** and bring your **left ribcage toward your left hip**.\n* Lift both shoulders a few inches; keep elbow wide and gaze forward.\n* Knees and legs stay quiet—movement comes from your **obliques**, not from tugging the head.\n\n4. Pause\n\n* Hold the top position for **1 second**, keep breathing softly, feel the side squeeze.\n\n5. Lower with control\n\n* **Inhale** and lower your shoulders back to the start without collapsing. Maintain tension.\n\n6.

If you feel unstable, or like you're losing your balance, practice this method with a wall or railing near by. Place your hands on the wall or the railing. 3. Lift your heels until you're standing on your tippy toes. Distribute most of your weight onto the balls of your feet, and keep your legs straight. 4. Stay on your tippy toes for two seconds. Then, begin to lower your heels, and move your weight away from the balls of your feet. Lower your heels until they're below the step, or platform.

Choose the right heels\n\n* Pick a stable pair: block heel or wedge, 2–3 in (5–7.5 cm), secure ankle strap, good fit.\n* Add non-slip sole grips if the bottoms are slick.\n\n2. Prep & warm up (1–2 min)\n\n* Ankle circles (both directions), calf raises, gentle hamstring/calf stretch.\n* Check straps/buckles are snug.\n\n3. Posture setup\n\n* Stand tall: ears over shoulders, shoulders over hips, ribs stacked, neutral pelvis.\n* Engage your core lightly; look where you’re going (not at your feet).\n\n4. Start with short, quick steps\n\n* Keep strides small to stay balanced.\n* Aim for a light, quick cadence rather than long reaches.\n\n5. Soft forefoot landing\n\n* Touch down gently near the ball of the foot, then roll through—avoid stabbing the heel first.\n* Keep toes pointing forward; don’t let ankles collapse inward.\n\n6. Use compact arm swing\n\n* Elbows ~90°, swing close to the body to counterbalance without twisting your torso.\n\n7. Pick safe surfaces\n\n* Prefer smooth, dry, even ground.\n* Avoid grates, cobblestones, grass, wet tile, and steep slopes.\n* If you must cross hazards, slow to a walk.\n\n8. Braking & turning\n\n* To slow: shorten steps, keep torso tall, don’t lean back.\n* For turns: take several tiny steps (no sharp pivots on a planted heel).\n\n9. Emergency stop & recovery\n\n* If you wobble: plant both feet shoulder-width, knees soft, lower your heels toward flat, then reset.\n* If a heel catches: stop, step back out, don’t yank forward.\n\n10. Cool down & care\n\n* Walk it off for 30–60 seconds, stretch calves/arches.\n* Inspect tips/heel caps; swap to flats if feet feel fatigued.\n\n### Practice Drills (build skill before full running)\n\n* March in place in heels (30–60s).\n* Walk–jog intervals: 10–20m jog, 20–30m walk; repeat 4–6x.\n* Figure-8 weaving around two cones/chairs to train controlled turns.\n\n### Safety Notes\n\n* Running in heels increases risk of ankle/knee injury—only do brief sprints when necessary.\n* Never run in very high, narrow stilettos or loose shoes.\n* Carry foldable flats as a backup.\n\nIf you’d like, I can generate alternate visuals (e.g., a printable poster or a horizontal storyboard) or tailor the steps to your specific heel height.\n",

    "question": "How to do a squat with a Squat Rack? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Start with a low weight. The most important thing with squats is to have the correct form, so you shouldn't attempt weighted squats until you can perform body weight squats with perfect form. Start with a low weight — maybe just using the bar (which weighs 45lbs) — and slowly build yourself up to heavier weights as your squat technique and muscle strength improves. 2. Position the bar correctly. Set up the squat rack so the bar is slightly below shoulder level. Position the safety bars so they are low enough to allow you to squat down fully with the bar on your shoulders. When you're ready, duck under the bar and grip it widely with your palms facing forward. Rest the bar across your upper back (not your neck). If this feels uncomfortable for you, try using a bar pad. 3. Squat using the same technique as the body weight squat. Place your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, with your toes pointing slightly outwards. Hinge your hips and push your butt backwards until your hamstrings are parallel with the floor. Keep your chest up, your shoulders back and your eyes looking straight ahead. Remember to keep your back straight — this is especially important when you are squatting with heavy weights. Push out of the squat with your heels and don't let your knees cave in towards the center. If this happens, you may need to reduce your weight. 4. Inhale on the way down, exhale on the way back up. Breathing deeply is very important when squatting heavy weights. If you hold your breath you can become dizzy, nauseous or even blackout. Take a deep breath in as you squat down and exhale powerfully as you rise up. Maintaining this breathing pattern will give you the energy you need to keep going. If you're pushing yourself to get another few repetitions, don't be afraid to pause between repetitions to take a couple of deep breaths.",

Set J-cups & safeties → 2) Load bar & collars → 3) Unrack & walkout → 4) Stance & brace → 5) Descend → 6) Bottom position & depth → 7) Drive up → 8) Re-rack, plus a “Common mistakes” box (knees caving, heels lifting, bar drifting forward, excessive arch/round).\n\n# Text steps (detailed)\n\n1. Rack setup\n\n* Set J-cups around mid-chest so the bar is ~1–2 in (2–5 cm) below shoulder height.\n* Set safety pins just below your expected bottom depth (they should catch the bar if you fail without touching it during good reps).\n\n2. Load & secure\n\n* Load plates evenly and add collars. Clear the area behind you.\n\n3. Bar position & grip\n\n* Walk under the bar. Place it across the upper traps (high-bar) or slightly lower on the rear delts (low-bar)—choose one and keep it consistent.\n* Hands just outside shoulder width, squeeze the bar, wrists neutral (not bent back), elbows angled down/back to lock the upper back.\n\n4. Stance & bracing\n\n* Step under the bar with feet under hips, stand tall to unrack.\n* Take 1–2 controlled steps back.\n* Set feet shoulder-width (give or take), toes turned out ~10–30°.\n* Big breath into your belly and sides, brace your core 360°, ribs stacked over pelvis.\n\n5. The descent\n\n* Keep the bar over your mid-foot.\n* Break at hips and knees together; let the knees track over your toes (not collapsing inward).\n* Maintain a neutral spine and steady gaze (chin tucked, eyes forward).\n\n6. Bottom position & depth\n\n* Aim for hip crease at or just below the top of the knee (or the deepest pain-free, controlled range you can maintain).\n* Shins roughly forward, whole foot glued to the floor, weight mid-foot to heel.\n\n7. The ascent\n\n* Drive the floor away, push up through mid-foot/heels.\n* Keep knees tracking over toes and chest tall; think “stand up with the bar” and “drive hips and chest together.”\n* Exhale through the sticking point or finish the rep, then reset your breath between reps.\n\n8. Re-rack safely\n\n* Step forward until both sides touch the uprights, then sit the bar straight down into the J-cups.\n* Don’t let go until you’re sure it’s seated.\n\n9. Safety & spotting tips\n\n* Warm up with the empty bar, then small jumps.\n* Shoes with firm, flat or lifting soles improve stability.\n* Use a spotter for heavy sets (they should follow your torso and assist only if the bar stalls).\n* If you must bail alone: drop to the safeties by sitting back/soft knees and letting the bar settle on the pins—then step forward out.\n\n10. Common mistakes to avoid\n\n* Knees caving in hard.\n* Heels lifting or rocking to toes.\n* Bar drifting forward of mid-foot.\n* Over-arching or rounding the back.\n* Rushing the walkout (take only 1–2 steps).\n\n11. Simple programming starter\n\n* 3–5 sets × 3–8 reps, leaving 1–3 reps in reserve. Rest 2–4 minutes.\n\nWant a version tailored to front squats or low-bar specifics?

    "reference_text": "1. Fit the blade of the paddle in the space between your thumb and index finger. If you look at your hand you’ll see the “V” shape that your thumb and index finger form. Place the paddle in your hand and move it so that its inside right bottom edge rests in that “V”. 2. Wrap your middle, ring, and pinky fingers around the handle. These are the only fingers you use to hold the ping paddle handle with a shakehand grip. These fingers should look similar to how they look when you’re shaking someone’s hand. Try moving the paddle up and down in a hand-shaking motion to the feel for this grip. 3. Rest your index finger against the outside of the paddle. Again, think of shaking someone’s hand. Your index finger is usually pointed outwards instead of curled in. This will help stabilize the paddle when you swing. If it feels more comfortable, let the tip of your finger rest against the side edge. 4. Curl your thumb around the front of the handle if you want greater wrist flexibility. This is called a shallow shakehand grip, and it's probably the most natural grip for beginners. It’s great for high freedom of movement for the paddle, which will make returning the ball easier. While this grip is usually pretty natural feeling, if it doesn't feel right to you, that may be a sign to try something else. 5. Rest your thumb against the front face of the paddle if you want a firmer grip. While this deep shakehand grip limits wrist flexibility, it works well for precise shots that don’t need a lot of power. Holding your paddle this way will also make it easy to switch the paddle from side to side, so it's great for both forehand and backhand shots. You can always switch between this thumb position and wrapping your thumb around the handle to get the benefits of both! 6. Keep your grip loose. Of course you want to grip the paddle firmly enough so it doesn’t fly out of your hand when you play, but a person should still be able to grab the paddle from you with only slight resistance. A too-tight grip will limit wrist flexibility too much making it difficult to hit or spin the ball. The paddle should feel like a natural extension of your arm, moving as freely as you move your hand. 7. Hold the paddle so its edge is perpendicular to the ground. You’ll notice your wrist tilts slightly downward. While the angle of the paddle will shift as you play, you want your wrist to stay in this position. Avoid floppy wrists when you swing! This will lead to you mis-hitting the ball. You need your entire forearm to swing and if you move your wrists around too much they’ll get tired. 8. Rest the handle in the space between your thumb and index finger. See the “V” shape formed by your thumb and index finger. With the handle angled upwards, rest its edge inside that “V” the way you would a pen. 9. Grip the handle between your thumb and index finger. Form a loop around the handle. Imagine writing with the paddle like a pen or pencil, and try moving it around in a pen writing motion to get a feel for the grip. 10. Keep your remaining fingers relaxed if you want greater wrist flexibility. For the Chinese penhold grip, lightly grip the outside face of the paddle with the tips of your middle, ring, and pinky fingers. Keep your fingers in a relaxed position. Holding the paddle this way will give you a wide range of motion and make it easy to block and push the ball. This grip makes it hard to consistently use backhand topspin or the spinning of the ball using the outside part of the paddle. 11. Straighten your middle, ring, and pinky fingers for more powerful strokes. For the Korean/Japanese penhold grip, the edge of your middle finger should lightly grip the outside face of the paddle with your ring and pinky stacked on top of it. You want your fingers to be rigidly straight. Holding the paddle this way will let you easily return a ball when standing far away from the table. Straight fingers can restrict paddle blade movement, making it harder for you to switch the paddle angle to reach the ball. 12. Use the “V” grip for high power and ball spin. Hold the blade of the paddle between your index and middle finger, forming a “V” shape. Place your thumb where it feels most comfortable. This grip ideal for wide-angle shots. Keep in mind that isn’t as popular as the penhold or shakehand grip, so finding a coach that specializes in it can be hard. 13. Block effectively with the Seemiller grip. Wrap your fingers around the handle of the paddle and rest your index finger on its back face as close to the bottom edge as you can get it. Use your thumb to grip the paddle blade with your index finger from the other side. Since backhand wrist flexibility is limited for this style, you may want to make backhand shots using the forehand side of your paddle. 14. Achieve heavy topspin with the reverse penhold grip. Hold the paddle handle between your thumb and index finger and rest your remaining three fingers against the paddle's outside face, keeping them relaxed. Angle the paddle in your hand slightly up so you can use both sides of the paddle to hit the ball. This grip is very similar to other penhold grips. The difference comes down to the angle you hold paddle and your style of play, and it's not unusual to see this grip combined with the Chinese or Korean/Japanese penhold styles.",

    "generated_text": "Here are your step-by-step **text instructions** (the visual is provided separately above).\n\n# Shakehand grip (most common)\n\n1. Start neutral\n   Hold the handle like a handshake. Keep your wrist relaxed and the blade (paddle face) roughly vertical.\n\n2. Thumb & index placement\n   Rest your **thumb lightly on the forehand rubber** near the handle. Lay your **index finger across the backhand rubber**, roughly horizontal. They should form a soft “V” along the top of the handle bevel.\n\n3. Wrap the other fingers\n   Curl the remaining three fingers around the handle. Leave a small gap (about a fingertip) between your palm and the handle’s butt—no choking up, no palming the blade.\n\n4. Set pressure points\n   Apply gentle pressure mainly with **thumb and index**. Keep the other fingers loose so the wrist can move freely.\n\n5. Angle for strokes\n   For **forehands**, let the index side relax so the blade can close slightly. For **backhands**, add a touch more pressure with the thumb to open the blade. Adjust in millimeters, not inches.\n\n6. Quick checks\n   Blade makes ~90° with your forearm at rest; wrist feels free; you can wiggle the blade without it slipping.\n\n# Penhold grip (popular in East Asia)\n\n1. Pinch the neck\n   Pinch the front of the blade with **thumb and index** as if holding a pen. The “circle” they form sits just above the handle.\n\n2. Rear-finger support\n   Place the **other three fingers on the back** of the blade. Beginners usually “fan” them; some players “stack” the middle/ring fingers—both are fine.\n\n3. Keep space and softness\n   Leave space between palm and handle. Grip softly so the wrist is very mobile.\n\n4. Forehand feel\n   Most control comes from the thumb–index pinch. Keep the blade slightly closed for drives; open a touch for topspin.\n\n5. Backhand options\n   For traditional penhold, use the forehand side for many shots by rotating the wrist. For RPB (reverse penhold backhand), contact with the back side—keep those rear fingers relaxed to allow the flip.\n\n6. Quick checks\n   No squeezing; blade moves easily with wrist; contact points feel precise at the thumb/index.\n\n# Common mistakes to avoid\n\n* **Death grip** (too tight) → kills wrist speed and touch.\n* **Index finger too high** across the rubber → limits forehand.\n* **Thumb creeping up** onto the rubber → blocks backhand.\n* **Palming the blade** (covering rubber with the palm) → reduces spin and reach.\n\n# Fast reminders\n\n* Relax first, then add just enough firmness at contact.\n* Small pressure shifts (thumb ↔ index) fine-tune forehand/backhand angles.\n* Start with shakehand if you’re unsure; it’s the most versatile for beginners.\n\nIf you want, I can also generate a second image focused solely on **shakehand** or **penhold**, or make printable cue cards.\n",

    "reference_text": "1. Hold the ball straight out in front of you so that it is at the height of your chest. Drop it and let it bounce. As the ball begins to descend after this bounce, kick it back up into the air. Try to kick it with your dominant foot hard enough that it reaches chest height. Try to kick the ball with your foot angled slightly upward. Make sure to kick the ball with your laces. Make sure that your laces are not double knotted at first. The ball may bounce off of your laces at a weird angle if your laces are tied in a large knot. If you deflate the soccer ball a little bit, you will reduce the intensity of its bounce. The ball will be easier to control and won’t go flying every time you miss a kick. Once you’ve mastered the technique of juggling, you should fully inflate your ball. Keep your ankle 'locked' so that it stays angled and strong. A wobbly ankle leads to a wobbly kick. 2. Keep your knees slightly bent. Doing this will help you have better control over the ball. Do not lock your knees. Keep the foot you are not kicking with (your controlling foot) flat and firmly planted on the ground. It is important to be balanced while juggling the ball. In between touches, it is risky but useful to try to re-balance yourself such that you can maintain control of how you hit the ball each time. Always try to stay balanced on your toes, ready to make quick movements. The biggest key to balancing is to keep your knees bent and your eyes on the ball. 3. Practice until you can easily and consistently catch the ball in front of your stomach. You should not have to lean or reach to catch the ball. Then do the same with your other foot. Keep in mind that juggling with your non-dominant foot will be harder. Keep at it! 4. Increase the number of times you let the ball bounce off your feet. Instead of catching the ball every time you kick it, kick it up into the air and as it falls, kick it up again rather than letting it bounce on the ground. Try to keep the ball under control. Focus on juggling with one foot until you feel confident, then switch to the other foot. Practice until you feel confident juggling with both feet. You can \"catch\" the ball on your foot with careful practice by cushioning the fall of the ball and holding it in place with your foot and shin.",

Continuous (no bounce)\n\n* Pop with one foot and, before it drops too far, pop with the other.\n* Aim for knee-to-waist height; stay balanced with small, light hops.\n\n7. Add thighs\n\n* When the ball rises too high for your feet, cushion and lift with your thigh.\n* Keep knees level; hit the mid-thigh so the ball goes straight up.\n\n8. Mix surfaces & control\n\n* Combine feet and thighs in a rhythm (R foot → L foot → R thigh → L foot, etc.).\n* Keep your torso quiet, eyes on the lower half of the ball, ankle locked on every touch.\n\n9. Build consistency (mini goals)\n\n* 5 touches total → 10 → 20 without moving much from your spot.\n* Then try “weak foot only” sets.\n\n10. Quick fixes for common mistakes\n\n* Ball drifting forward: lean slightly over the ball; strike more under the center.\n* Spinning ball: hit with a firm, flat laces surface; avoid toe-poking.\n* Popping too high: relax and hit lighter; aim for consistent knee-to-waist height.\n* Chasing the ball: take smaller hops and keep it centered between your shoulders.\n\nWant a version that adds heading (forehead) or chest control next?",

Make sure that the balls of your feet are solidly planted on the edge of the step. Your heels should be over the edge. If you feel unstable, or like you're losing your balance, practice this method with a wall or railing near by. Place your hands on the wall or the railing. 3. Lift your heels until you're standing on your tippy toes. Distribute most of your weight onto the balls of your feet, and keep your legs straight. 4. Stay on your tippy toes for two seconds. Then, begin to lower your heels, and move your weight away from the balls of your feet. Lower your heels until they're below the step, or platform. You should be feeling your calf muscles stretch on the downward movement. Repeat this sequence until you feel tired.",

For best results, try bending your knees to a 90-degree angle, then standing back up. [1] X Expert Source Dean Theriot Personal Trainer Expert Interview 2. Keep your knees behind your toes. This protects your knees and back and helps you achieve maximum results. When you move into a squat, bend your knees so that they move directly over your feet, without going further than your toes. [3] X Expert Source Dean Theriot Personal Trainer Expert Interview 3. Keep your feet shoulder-width apart. For a standard free squat, start by keeping your feet under your shoulders. This help to avoid stress on your knees. 4. Angle your feet for plié squats. A plié squat is a free squat done with a wide stance. For these, it is important to angle your feet out and to bend your knees so they move directly over your feet. Begin by doing these at only a half-range of motion, and work up to getting your knee bends to 90 degrees. 5. Stop at the bottom. After you build up some leg strength, you may begin to \"break 90,\" or allow your squat to deepen more than a 90-degree bend in your knees. However, it is important to stop when your thighs lightly come into contact with your calves. Going beyond this can place unnecessary stress on your knees.",

If anything hurts (sharp pain), stop and adjust range or seek a pro.\n\n## 1) Set Your Stance\n\n* Feet about shoulder-width apart (a little wider or narrower based on comfort).\n* Toes turned slightly out (≈5–20°) so knees can track over them.\n* Distribute weight through the whole foot (heel + big toe + little toe). Look ahead.\n\n## 2) Brace\n\n* Take a deep breath “360°” into your belly and sides.\n* Gently lock ribs down as if prepping for a cough; keep spine neutral.\n* Set shoulders down/back. Lightly squeeze glutes.\n\n## 3) Initiate: Hips Back, Knees Out\n\n* Start the squat by sending the hips slightly back, then let the knees bend.\n* Let knees track in line with the toes (don’t cave inward).\n* Reach your arms forward a bit for balance if helpful.\n\n## 4) Descend Under Control\n\n* Lower smoothly; keep chest proud and back neutral.\n* Keep heels flat; stay balanced over mid-foot.\n* Go as low as **your** mobility allows—aim for thighs parallel to the floor or lower without losing your brace.\n\n## 5) Check the Bottom Position\n\n* Knees track over toes; don’t collapse inward.\n* Weight balanced (not on toes only; heels stay down).\n* Avoid excessive pelvis tuck (“butt wink”). If it appears, stop just above that range.\n\n## 6) Drive Up\n\n* Push the floor away through mid-foot/heels.\n* Stand up by extending hips and knees together (no shooting hips up first).\n* Keep knees tracking over toes; exhale through the sticking point.\n\n## 7) Finish Tall\n\n* Stand tall with hips and knees fully extended.\n* Reset your breath/bracing before the next rep.\n\n---\n\n## Breathing Cue (Simple)\n\n* **Inhale & brace** before you descend → **exhale** as you drive up.\n* For heavier sets, you can hold a gentle brace until you pass the hardest point, then exhale.\n\n## Common Mistakes → Quick Fixes\n\n* **Heels lift:** Widen stance slightly; slow down; work ankle mobility; try a small heel lift (5–10 mm).\n* **Knees cave in:** Think “spread the floor” or “push knees toward pinky toes.”\n* **Back rounds:** Re-brace; keep chest proud; shorten depth slightly; include core work.\n* **Leaning too far forward:** Bring heels under hips; use counterbalance arms; keep gaze forward.\n* **Bouncing/relaxing at bottom:** Pause briefly; keep tension.\n\n## Regressions (Easier)\n\n* **Box/Chair Squat:** Tap a box/chair behind you for depth control.\n* **Supported Squat:** Hold a doorframe/TRX for assistance.\n* **Heel-elevated Squat:** Place thin plates under heels to ease ankle demand.\n\n## Helpful Progressions (Harder)\n\n* **Goblet Squat (light weight)** for counterbalance and torso position.\n* **Tempo Squat:** 3-sec lower, no bounce, smooth up.\n* **Pause Squat:** 1–2 sec hold at the bottom with tension.\n* **Split Squat / Pistol to Box** for single-leg control.\n\n## Suggested Sets & Reps\n\n* Beginners: **3 × 8–10 reps**, rest 60–90 s.\n* Warm-up: 5 min light cardio + 2–3 easy ramp-up sets.\n\n> Goal: Smooth, controlled reps with consistent depth and balance.

    "question": "How to Do a Layup in Basketball? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Dribble close to the basket with your right hand. Since you're doing a right-handed layup, angle your approach toward the right side of the basket. You want to get close enough to have easy access to the basket, but not so close that you end up directly under it. Layups are often taken off of a running dribble. Practice approaching the basket slowly at first, and increase your speed once you've got the footwork down. You can do a right-handed layup if you're starting near the center or right side of the basket. If you're approaching the basket from the left, you'll want to do a left-handed layup. 2. Step toward the basket with your right foot. When you're just a few feet from the basket, take a step toward it with our right foot. Use this step to gain distance and position yourself within easy shooting range. Dribble the ball one last time just outside your right foot. 3. Jump off of your left foot. As soon as your left foot lands, use it to jump in the direction of the basket. Your body should be moving toward the basket, but don't lean forward. Ideally, you'll be positioned close enough to the basket that you can jump straight up to take your shot. As you jump, bring the ball out of the dribble to your chest to prepare for the shot. 4. Shoot with your right arm as you lift your right leg. As you jump, imagine a string attached to your right arm and your right leg. Move them at the same time as you shoot, as though someone were pulling upward on the string. Your right knee should be bent and pointed toward the basket while your right arm moves up to shoot the ball. Arch your arm toward the basket. Shoot with your elbow slightly bent, so that your arm looks like the neck of a swan. When you're doing a layup, the shooting technique is slightly different from that of a regular shot. Instead of using your left hand to steady the ball, you want to shoot the ball using only your right hand. This gives you more reach, and since you're so close to the basket that it's difficult to miss the shot, you don't really need your left hand to steady the ball. As you shoot, slightly rotate your wrist inward to give the ball a little bit of spin, rather than snapping your wrist forward as you would for a regular shot. The gentle spin will keep it from hammering off the rim or backboard with too much force. 5. Aim for the sweet spot on the backboard. One of the reasons a layup is such a sure bet is because you can always use the backboard to help ease the shot into the basket. When you're doing a right-handed layup, the sweet spot is slightly above the top right corner of the small square in the center of the backboard. This spot absorbs the impact of the ball and drops it right down through the net. You'll get two points no matter how you make your shot, but it's better to aim for the backboard instead of trying to just tip the ball over the rim. The backboard allows more room for error, but if you hit the rim funny the ball will bounce right out. There's nothing worse than missing a wide-open layup when you have full access to the basket, so work on hitting that sweet spot every time. 6. Practice until your muscles remember the movement. The layup is a fundamental basketball move that will become second nature after you practice it enough. You should get to the point where your body remembers what to do and you don't have to think about which foot to put forward and which one to jump off: you just do it. Do layups as part of every basketball practice . As you practice, you'll start to get a good sense for how fast to approach the basket and from what distance to begin your layup footwork and launch into a jump. Work on doing layups while you're being defended or off of a long pass.",

This movement can be made easier by placing your hands and arms lower on your body (crossing arms in front of your chest) or harder, by placing your hands and arms past your head (arms extended above your head). 2. Turn your legs to one side. With your knees remaining bent, turn at your waist and bring both of your legs to one side of your body, down to the floor. Your legs should be lying on top of each other. As you bring your legs down to the floor, keep your shoulder blades and the upper part of your back flat on the floor. Your rib cage should be down and not flared out in this position. If you overextend, you risk straining your upper back. [4] X Expert Source Brendon Rearick Personal Trainer & Strength Coach Expert Interview 3. Crunch to your side. Place your hands behind or at the sides of your head. Flex your abdominal muscles, and lift your shoulders off the floor. Be sure to keep your shoulders straight and level just as you would for a normal crunch. Hold the position for a moment, then release your constricted abdominal muscles to slowly bring your shoulders back down to the mat. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Do not pull at your head and neck to complete the crunch.

    "question": "How to Catch a Baseball? Show visual steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Get the right glove. Your glove becomes an extension of your hand when catching a baseball. It must fit your hand properly to work efficiently. As a general rule of thumb, players under the age of 12 will use a glove in the 10–11 inch (25.4–27.9 cm) range. Older players will use something between 11 and 13 inch glove. Before playing regularly with your glove, it’s important to beak in your glove. One of the best ways to break in your glove is by practicing your catch. [1] X Expert Source Isaac Hess Baseball Coach & Instructor Expert Interview 2. Position your body. Catching a baseball relies heavily on your stance and body position. You should be in the athletic position to prepare catching a ball. The athletic position takes the following into effect: Bend your knees slightly. This will give you the flexibility to lung for the ball and keep your mind focused. Keep your shoulders positioned towards the target. This will make it easier to visualize and react once the ball comes towards you. Stand on the balls of your feet instead of standing flat-footed. 3. Watch the ball. The key to catching a baseball is to never let the ball out of your sight. Keep your eyes fixed from the time the ball leaves the thrower's hand until it lands in your glove. By watching the ball, you can track the ball’s flight plan, and prepare for the right stance to catch the ball. ”You can’t catch what you can’t see,” meaning it'll be difficult to catch the ball if your eye is off the ball. 4. Go to the ball. Don’t feel inclined to stay anchored in one place, but instead move to catch the ball. If the ball is thrown and you can tell it will land behind you, run backwards while watching the ball. In baseball, catchers play by zone defense. When the ball enters your zone, it’s your job to move to it. 5. Position your glove. Hold your glove with your palm facing outwards in front of your body. Position the glove in the direction of the target who is throwing the ball. If the ball is thrown above your belly button, you can use this stance to catch the ball with little adjustment. If the throw is below your belly button, rotate your glove so that your fingers are pointed down. When the ball is thrown above your body, use the first position mentioned, but extend your arm upwards. 6. Catch the baseball. Catch the ball in the pocket of the glove. The pocket is another name for the palm of the glove. Close your hand immediately once the ball makes contact with your glove. Get into the practice of using your second hand to secure the catch. Using your second hand will also prepare you to throw once you become a catcher. Your free hand needs to have quick access to the ball. 7. Keep your vision clear. Be careful not to obstruct your vision with your glove when going for the catch. If a ball is heading towards your face, move your glove to the position at the last second. This might take some practice, but the goal is to watch the ball till the final second. Practice throwing with a friend to avoid a black eye on game day. You can usually reposition yourself to avoid your face crossing the ball’s flight path.",

Present the glove\n   • **Fly balls/pop-ups:** glove **fingers up**, pocket to the ball at about eye level or slightly above your head.\n   • **Grounders:** get low; glove **fingers down** with the heel near the ground, body square to the ball.\n\n4. Soften the catch (“give”)\n   • Let the glove travel a bit with the ball’s momentum. Don’t stab.\n\n5. Use two hands\n   • As the ball hits the pocket, cover it with your throwing hand immediately.\n\n6. Funnel to your chest\n   • Bring the glove to the center of your body to secure it and prepare a throw or tag.\n\n7. Communicate & position\n   • For fly balls say “Mine!” and take priority if you have the easier angle. Avoid backpedaling—turn and run to the spot, then get set.\n\n8. Bare-hand (only on soft tosses/foul balls in the stands)\n   • Keep fingers together, elbows slightly bent, and **give** with the ball. Avoid trying to bare-hand hard line drives.\n\n9. Common cues\n   • “Fingers up for sky; fingers down for ground.”\n   • “Move your feet, not just your glove.”\n   • “Two hands; funnel to chest.”\n\n10. Quick practice drill\n    • Toss yourself short pop-ups and grounders, focusing on glove angle and soft hands; progress to partner throws from different angles.\n\n---\n\nI also created a **visual step-by-step image** (separate from the text) showing ready stance, moving under a fly ball (fingers up), and fielding a grounder (fingers down) with two-hand secure and funnel to chest.\n",
