For best results, try bending your knees to a 90-degree angle, then standing back up. [1] X Expert Source Dean Theriot Personal Trainer Expert Interview 2. Keep your knees behind your toes. This protects your knees and back and helps you achieve maximum results. When you move into a squat, bend your knees so that they move directly over your feet, without going further than your toes. [3] X Expert Source Dean Theriot Personal Trainer Expert Interview 3. Keep your feet shoulder-width apart. For a standard free squat, start by keeping your feet under your shoulders. This help to avoid stress on your knees. 4. Angle your feet for plié squats. A plié squat is a free squat done with a wide stance. For these, it is important to angle your feet out and to bend your knees so they move directly over your feet. Begin by doing these at only a half-range of motion, and work up to getting your knee bends to 90 degrees. 5. Stop at the bottom. After you build up some leg strength, you may begin to \"break 90,\" or allow your squat to deepen more than a 90-degree bend in your knees. However, it is important to stop when your thighs lightly come into contact with your calves. Going beyond this can place unnecessary stress on your knees.",

    "generated_text": "# Free (Bodyweight) Squat — Text Guide\n\nFollow these clear, safe steps. If anything hurts (sharp pain), stop and adjust range or seek a pro.\n\n## 1) Set Your Stance\n\n* Feet about shoulder-width apart (a little wider or narrower based on comfort).\n* Toes turned slightly out (≈5–20°) so knees can track over them.\n* Distribute weight through the whole foot (heel + big toe + little toe). Look ahead.\n\n## 2) Brace\n\n* Take a deep breath “360°” into your belly and sides.\n* Gently lock ribs down as if prepping for a cough; keep spine neutral.\n* Set shoulders down/back. Lightly squeeze glutes.\n\n## 3) Initiate: Hips Back, Knees Out\n\n* Start the squat by sending the hips slightly back, then let the knees bend.\n* Let knees track in line with the toes (don’t cave inward).\n* Reach your arms forward a bit for balance if helpful.\n\n## 4) Descend Under Control\n\n* Lower smoothly; keep chest proud and back neutral.\n* Keep heels flat; stay balanced over mid-foot.\n* Go as low as **your** mobility allows—aim for thighs parallel to the floor or lower without losing your brace.\n\n## 5) Check the Bottom Position\n\n* Knees track over toes; don’t collapse inward.\n* Weight balanced (not on toes only; heels stay down).\n* Avoid excessive pelvis tuck (“butt wink”). If it appears, stop just above that range.\n\n## 6) Drive Up\n\n* Push the floor away through mid-foot/heels.\n* Stand up by extending hips and knees together (no shooting hips up first).\n* Keep knees tracking over toes; exhale through the sticking point.\n\n## 7) Finish Tall\n\n* Stand tall with hips and knees fully extended.\n* Reset your breath/bracing before the next rep.\n\n---\n\n## Breathing Cue (Simple)\n\n* **Inhale & brace** before you descend → **exhale** as you drive up.\n* For heavier sets, you can hold a gentle brace until you pass the hardest point, then exhale.\n\n## Common Mistakes → Quick Fixes\n\n* **Heels lift:** Widen stance slightly; slow down; work ankle mobility; try a small heel lift (5–10 mm).\n* **Knees cave in:** Think “spread the floor” or “push knees toward pinky toes.”\n* **Back rounds:** Re-brace; keep chest proud; shorten depth slightly; include core work.\n* **Leaning too far forward:** Bring heels under hips; use counterbalance arms; keep gaze forward.\n* **Bouncing/relaxing at bottom:** Pause briefly; keep tension.\n\n## Regressions (Easier)\n\n* **Box/Chair Squat:** Tap a box/chair behind you for depth control.\n* **Supported Squat:** Hold a doorframe/TRX for assistance.\n* **Heel-elevated Squat:** Place thin plates under heels to ease ankle demand.\n\n## Helpful Progressions (Harder)\n\n* **Goblet Squat (light weight)** for counterbalance and torso position.\n* **Tempo Squat:** 3-sec lower, no bounce, smooth up.\n* **Pause Squat:** 1–2 sec hold at the bottom with tension.\n* **Split Squat / Pistol to Box** for single-leg control.\n\n## Suggested Sets & Reps\n\n* Beginners: **3 × 8–10 reps**, rest 60–90 s.\n* Warm-up: 5 min light cardio + 2–3 easy ramp-up sets.\n\n> Goal: Smooth, controlled reps with consistent depth and balance. Quality first; load later.\n",

Keep gaze forward.\n\n3. **Press Up**\n\n* Drive the dumbbells **up and slightly back**, letting your head move a touch back so the bells travel close to your face.\n* Keep ribs from flaring; maintain tight glutes and abs.\n* Elbows stay under (or just in front of) the wrists—don’t let them flare wide.\n\n4. **Lockout**\n\n* Finish with arms straight, **biceps near ears**, shoulders down (no shrug).\n* Exhale at the top or through the sticking point. Pause briefly under control.\n\n5. **Lower**\n\n* Pull the weights back to shoulders on a controlled 2–3-second descent.\n* Keep torso tall; don’t lean back or arch.\n\n6. **Breathe & Repeat**\n\n* Reset your brace each rep. Perform 6–12 reps for hypertrophy or 3–6 for strength.\n* Stop 1–2 reps shy of form breakdown.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Tips\n\n* Start lighter than you think; build up in 2–5 lb jumps.\n* If your low back arches, **tighten abs and glutes** or switch to a half-kneeling stance.\n* Think “press the body **under** the bells” rather than pushing them far forward.\n\n### Common Mistakes → Fixes\n\n* **Flaring ribs / big back arch** → Squeeze glutes, exhale, knit ribs down.\n* **Bent-back wrists** → Stack knuckles over forearms; grip the handles firmly.\n* **Press path in front** → Aim slightly back at the top so bells finish over mid-foot.\n* **Shrugging** → Keep shoulder blades set down; don’t chase height with traps.\n\n### Variations\n\n* **Seated press** for more stability.\n* **Arnold press** for extra front-delt/rotation work.\n* **Single-arm press** to train anti-lean core control.\n\nStay smooth and pain-free—if you feel shoulder pinching, reduce range, rotate palms in, or stop.",

    "question": "How to Smash in Badminton? Show visual steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Approach the shuttlecock with a forehand grip . Be on your toes and ready to return the shuttle with a smash at any instant. You never know when a smash-worthy shot will present itself. When the shuttle is hit to your end of the court, get underneath and behind it as quickly as possible. The sooner you reach the spot where the shuttle appears to be incoming, the higher it will be and the more time you’ll have to set up a killer smash. You may hear serious badminton players call this kind of maneuver “injection of pace.” All this means is that you add a boost of speed so you have more time to react. 2. Assume a surefooted stance. If the shuttle comes in hot, you might not have a lot of time to react. In ideal conditions, both of your feet will be pointing to the side of the court. Your feet should be about shoulder width apart, your knees slightly bent, and your eyes tracking the ball. Balance is more important at this point than winding up for your smash. If you’re not well-balanced, it’ll negatively impact your smash. 3. Raise your arms and prepare to strike. Hold your racket upright and as far back as possible while still being comfortable. The arm of your non-racket hand should be bent at the elbow and the hand should be at about chin level. The fingers of your non-racket hand can be positioned however you like. Curling your fingers into a fist is most popular, but you can leave them spread out, too. As you prepare to strike, imagine the angle the shuttle will travel. It should be as steep downward as possible while still making it over the net. Raising your non-racket hand will act as a counterbalance for your racket hand, providing greater stability for your smash. 4. Strike the shuttlecock. Aim to connect with the shuttle at the highest point possible. Inhale deeply before you swing and stretch out your non-racket arm so it's roughly shoulder level. Swing with your full racket-arm and exhale as you do so. As you swing, your racket foot should shuffle forward. Power is important at this point, but even more important is hitting the shuttle with the center of the racket. When you feel the racket come in contact with the shuttle, snap your wrist downward. This will add power and steepness to the stroke. You can increase the power of your smash by contracting your abs at the same time you swing at the shuttle. 5. Follow through with your swing and recover for the next rally. An overhead smash will be much more difficult for your opponent(s) to return. But in the event they manage to get it back over the net, you’ll need to be ready to send it right back.",

    "generated_text": "Here are the **text steps** (separate from the image):\n\n1. Grip\n   Use a relaxed forehand “handshake” grip (not panhandle). V-shape between thumb and index sits on the bevel. Keep fingers loose so you can tighten at impact.\n\n2. Ready stance + split step\n   Face the net, feet wider than shoulders, knees bent, racket up. As your opponent hits, make a light split step to react.\n\n3. Move back & turn sideways\n   Chassé or scissor-step to the rear court. Turn your body so your non-racket shoulder points toward the net.\n\n4. Load the swing\n   Non-racket arm points up at the shuttle for balance. Elbow high, racket head drops behind you; chest and hips coil.\n\n5. Set your feet\n   Rear foot behind, front foot slightly open. If possible, prepare a scissor jump (rear→front) to transfer weight forward.\n\n6. Start the swing from the body\n   Uncoil hips and shoulders first, then the elbow comes forward. Keep wrist relaxed—don’t “push” with a straight arm.\n\n7. Contact point\n   Reach fully and strike the shuttle **slightly in front** of your body at your highest comfortable point.\n\n8. Pronation & snap\n   At contact, rotate the forearm (pronation) and whip the wrist. Think “throwing” the racket head through the shuttle.\n\n9. Follow-through\n   Let the racket continue across your body naturally; don’t stop it short. This preserves power and protects your shoulder.\n\n10. Land & recover\n    Land in a scissor (rear foot forward), take a small hop, and return to base ready for the next shot.\n\nQuick tips\n\n* Aim steep and fast rather than only flat and hard.\n* Mix in drop shots and clears so opponents can’t camp on your smash.\n* Common mistakes: panhandle grip, contacting too far back, swinging only with the arm, and failing to recover.\n\nIf you’d like, I can also provide a short practice plan (shadow swings → multi-shuttle → target cones) to help you master it.\n",

Pick a load that keeps your neck relaxed and form crisp.\n\n**Form checkpoints (quick cues)**\n\n* “**Ears to shoulders, not elbows to ribs.**”\n* “**Arms long, wrists neutral.**”\n* “**Don’t roll** the shoulders forward.”\n* “**Tall neck**—no chin jutting.”\n* Bells stay near your thighs; torso doesn’t sway.\n\n**Common mistakes to avoid**\n\n* Bending the elbows or turning it into a curl.\n* Letting the ribs flare or leaning back.\n* Jerking/bouncing the weight; losing control on the way down.\n* Rolling the shoulders in circles.\n\n**Variations**\n\n* **Single-arm suitcase shrug:** one kettlebell; keep hips level—great for anti-lean stability.\n* **Paused top shrug:** 2–3-sec hold at the top.\n* **Heavier, low-rep sets (6–10)** once form is solid.\n\n**Warm-up idea (quick)**\n\n* 30–60s light band pull-apart holds + 10 scapular wall slides, then a light set of shrugs to groove the motion.\n\n> Tip: If you feel neck strain, reduce load, shorten range, and emphasize “shoulders down” between reps. Discomfort in the joint = stop and reassess.\n\n---\n\n**Visual steps**\nI generated a separate step-by-step kettlebell-shrug infographic above to match these instructions.\n",

    "reference_text": "1. Start in a squatting position. Bend your knees and come close to the floor, almost as though you are going to sit. Hover just above the ground, with your thighs hugging close to your calves. As you get more comfortable with this move, you can start from a standing squat. Eventually you will start from a completely standing position. 2. Round your back. Bend your elbows close to your body so that your hands are by your ears. Tuck your head between your arms and curl your back forwards. As you get more comfortable with the position, you can start with your hands extended out in front of you. 3. Roll backwards. When your head hits the mat, tuck your chin and push the ground with your hands. Think about pushing your body away from the mat with your hands. Be sure to keep your shoulders and arms strong and close to your head. They are your point of strength. 4. Swing your legs over your head. Using the momentum of your legs and the strength of your arms, bring your legs over your head and your feet to the mat. You may have to use your core strength as well. Kick your legs to gain momentum, but squeeze your abs to pull your feet to the mat. 5. Stand up. Once your feet hit the mat, press against the mat with your hands, pushing your upper body up to follow your feet. You will be in a squat with your hands on the mat. Stand up from there, with your arms up. In order to practice for your back extension, you can practice ending in a pushup position instead of a standing position. When your feet hit the mat, press against the mat with your hands and use your ab muscles to straighten out into a plank position. Hold that position to build strength.",

Keep neck neutral (gaze ~1–2 m ahead of the floor).\n\n3. **Brace**\n\n   * Inhale through the nose; lightly brace your abs and squeeze your glutes to set a neutral spine.\n\n4. **Lower (the hinge)**\n\n   * Hinge at the hips and **control** the descent. Let the torso tip forward while keeping your back neutral (don’t round).\n   * Stop when you feel a hamstring stretch or when your torso is slightly below parallel. Tempo idea: ~2–3 seconds down.\n\n5. **Pause**\n\n   * Brief 1-second pause at the bottom while staying tight; keep shoulders away from ears.\n\n6. **Raise**\n\n   * Drive your hips into the pad, squeeze glutes/hamstrings, and lift the torso until it’s **in line** with your legs.\n   * Exhale as you come up. Do **not** hyperextend or arch past straight.\n\n7. **Finish & repeat**\n\n   * Hold the top for half a second in neutral, then repeat for 8–12 smooth reps.\n\n**Progressions & variations**\n\n* Easier: hands on hips → arms across chest.\n* Harder: hands behind head → hold a light plate/dumbbell tight to chest.\n* Tempo challenge: 3–4 sec down, 2-sec pause at bottom, 1 sec up.\n* Range: only as deep as you can keep a neutral spine.\n\n**Common mistakes to avoid**\n\n* Rounding the lower back on the way down.\n* Throwing the torso/swinging to get up.\n* Hyperextending at the top (arching past a straight line).\n* Pad set too high (blocks the hips) or too low (digs into thighs).\n* Craning the neck up; keep it neutral.\n\n**Safety tips**\n\n* If you feel sharp pain (especially in the lower back), stop.\n* Keep motion at the **hips**, not by bending the spine.\n* Start with bodyweight and perfect control before adding load.\n\nIf you want, I can also give steps for a **flat-bench alternative** (no Roman chair) or tailor reps/sets to your program.\n",

    "question": "How to Do Bicep Curls? Show visual steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Start small and work your way up the dumbbell scale as you progress. If you are new to doing curls, or simply looking to maintain existing muscle tone, even 1 to 3 lb (0.45 to 1.36 kg) weights may be sufficient. Taking on too much weight causes a breakdown in technique and can easily lead to injuries of the elbow, wrist, or muscle tissue. If you are going to do 2-handed curls with a bar, the same principle holds. Start at a lower weight and work your way up slowly. Everyone is different, so start with lighter weights and find the maximum amount that permits you to do your desired number of repetitions (reps) while retaining the proper form. 2. Adjust your regime to suit your goal. Generally speaking, if you are seeking to maintain existing muscle tone and arm strength, it is better to do more reps per set with a lower dumbbell weight. If you are looking to build muscle, do fewer reps at a higher weight (but again, don’t sacrifice technique). For muscle maintenance, do 1 to 3 sets of 10 to 12 reps each, for each arm. For strength building, sets of 6 to 8 reps may be preferable. Let your body be your guide. If you can’t do the number of reps you seek, reduce the dumbbell weight. If necessary, start with 1 set per arm and build up to 3. Reader Poll: We asked 649 wikiHow readers what type of exercise they enjoy most for arm workouts, and 72% of them said weightlifting. 3. Isolate your body movement so that only the arm doing the curl is moving. Traditional biceps curls are done while standing, but can also be done easily and properly while seated. Creating a solid base with your body positioning is critical to achieving this goal. Stand with your feet at hip width and your knees slightly bent. Keep your back straight and your abdomen pulled in (but not uncomfortably so). Let your arms rest at your sides and look forward—into a mirror, if possible, to monitor your technique. Sit with your feet firmly on the ground, your back straight and abdomen in, your arms to the side, and your head looking forward. Make sure the chair or bench will not impede your arm motion (or the dumbbell’s) during the curls. 4. Keep it smooth and simple. In spite of the form displayed by the aspiring Mr. Universe you might run into at the gym, a bicep curl shouldn’t be a quick, jerking motion that involves the entire body. It is meant to be a slow, steady, consistent motion that isolates a single muscle group. You can do dumbbell curls with both arms at the same time (or alternating arms), but for simplicity’s sake (especially as a beginner), you should probably start with 1 arm at a time. Or, you can do curls with both arms at the same time by using a bar. If so, you will use the same arm motions as described below for a dumbbell. With the dumbbell securely in your hand, palm facing forward and arm loose to your side, exhale and slowly bend your elbow and contract your biceps to draw the weight upward. While lifting, try to keep every other part of your body still. Keep raising the weight until it is at shoulder height, or even touching your shoulder. Pause for a beat without stopping to let the weight rest on your shoulder. Inhale and slowly lower the weight back to the starting position. Don’t let it just drop back down — control the movement in each direction. 5. Don’t cheat yourself. Sacrificing form to lift bigger dumbbells not only risks injury, it also minimizes the benefits of the curls. “Maxing out” on a curl should mean getting the most out of each one, not hurting yourself by flailing around with a giant dumbbell. Keep your wrists straight and rigid throughout the entire curl. It is easy to cause injury by using your wrist as a lever or letting it swing loosely. Use wrist wraps if they help. [9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Don’t lean forward to start the curl, and/or rock backward during the lift. Your body should not be acting as a pendulum during the curl — this takes the focus away from your biceps, and can cause a loss of balance and possible injury. Don’t let the weight rest on your shoulder at the top of the motion. If you need a break during a set, you are using too much weight or doing too many reps. Likewise, don’t rest your elbows on your hips or the sides of your abdomen during the motion. You want the full weight of the dumbbells to be isolated on your biceps. 6. Return and repeat. When you finish a curl, make sure you extend your arm fully — leaving your elbow slightly bent is another cheat that will reduce the impact of each curl. Once you’ve returned the dumbbell to the proper starting position, pause just long enough to refocus and exhale as you begin the next lift. Rest for 30 to 90 seconds between sets, if you are doing more than 1. If you're curling 1 arm at a time, keep alternating arms while allowing 1 to rest between its sets. Again, it is better to reduce the weight, or your reps or sets, than to let your form break down.",

Hold a dumbbell in each hand at your sides.\n* Shoulders back and down, ribs stacked over hips, eyes forward.\n* Grip lightly, wrists straight (knuckles facing out), elbows close to your ribs.\n\n2. Brace\n\n* Inhale, engage your core and glutes. Keep a neutral spine—no leaning.\n\n3. Curl\n\n* Exhale as you bend the elbows and lift the weights toward your shoulders.\n* Keep elbows pinned to your sides; don’t let them drift forward.\n* As you lift, rotate forearms so palms face up by the top (supination).\n\n4. Squeeze\n\n* Pause briefly at the top. Feel the biceps working.\n* Don’t shrug or let wrists bend; forearms stay in line with the back of your hands.\n\n5. Lower\n\n* Inhale as you lower slowly for 2–3 seconds.\n* Fully straighten the elbows without locking; keep shoulders relaxed.\n\n6. Repeat\n\n* Perform 8–12 controlled reps for 2–4 sets. Rest 60–90 seconds between sets.\n* Choose a weight that leaves 1–2 reps “in the tank” at the end of each set.\n\n## Quick cues\n\n* Tempo: **2–0–2** (two seconds up, no pause, two seconds down).\n* Range: Full elbow extension to full elbow flexion without swinging.\n* Breath: Exhale up, inhale down.\n\n## Common mistakes to avoid\n\n* Swinging your torso or using momentum.\n* Elbows flaring away from your sides.\n* Bending or curling your wrists.\n* Cutting the range short or rushing the lowering phase.\n\n## Variations (optional)\n\n* **Hammer Curl:** Neutral grip the whole time; targets brachialis/forearm more.\n* **Barbell Curl:** Two hands on a bar; keep elbows tucked.\n* **Incline Dumbbell Curl:** On an incline bench; emphasizes the long head stretch.\n* **Concentration Curl:** Seated, elbow braced on inner thigh for strict form.\n\nWant a second visual for hammer curls or barbell curls too?\n",

    "question": "How to do a bench press? Show visual steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Begin by lying flat on the bench, with your body in a natural and relaxed position. Make sure that you are not holding your shoulders in an awkward position. Be sure to have a natural spinal curve. You do not want to have your lower back flat on the bench, but you do not want to force it to curve too much either. Instead, opt for a comfortable and natural position. You should have your feet flat on the ground, shoulder-width apart, and your shoulders touching the bench. Do not lift on a \"cushiony bench\" if you are a heavy lifter. When the bar and plates weigh more than 200 pounds plus the weight of your upper body, your shoulders will disappear into the bench and cause neck strain. Choose a proper bench that fits your shoulder width. A narrow bench is unstable and a wide bench prevents the upper arm from bending back. 2. Put your arms straight out to either side of you, and then bend your elbows, bringing your hands up to touch the bar. This is where you should position your hands. They should be about shoulder-width apart. Use the smooth rings in the bar as a reference for even hand placement. Where you position your hands will affect which muscle group you work most. Widen your grip slightly to increase the amount of pectoral muscles involved in this exercise, and bring your grip in slightly to increase your triceps involvement. For a standard bench press, opt for the normal grip. 3. Begin with just the bar weight to warm up before heavy lifting. Lift the bar off the rack and position it directly above the middle of your chest. Inhale as you lower it down, gently touching your chest — the middle of the sternum — with the bar. Do not bounce the bar off your chest, as this can cause serious injury and promotes bad form . Begin to exhale as you push the bar up and away from your body. Extend your arms to just under full extension. Repeat this for eight repetitions as your first set. Lift with a bar that has a little flex but is not \"whippy\". A stiff bar can be uncomfortable to lift with. All bars are made of metal and relatively stiff, but a bar with some flex feels better on the joints. The salesperson at the store will give you the right bar for your bodyweight, based on the formula for bodyweight and bench press. Generally, a beginning or intermediate lifter is not going to lift over his bodyweight plus 50%. Examine your goals when choosing a bar. For setting a personal record or a state record and above, use a bar with a standard diameter of 1 1 ⁄ 16 inches (2.7 cm). If not concerned with records, a thicker bar does not dig into the palms and is more comfortable. A thicker bar increases the distance of the lift and decreases the amount that can be lifted. A 1/8 (or 1/16) inch increase in bar diameter has a noticeable difference in feel and stability. 4. Rack the bar and add weight. Always use weight clips to prevent the weights from sliding off the bar in the event that you lift unevenly, do not lift without them. The bar by itself weighs 45 pounds. You will want to increase by five to ten pounds at a time until you find a comfortable weight. Practice extra caution if tall. Tall lifters with wide grips should use care not to crush their hands when racking the bar. Weight benches were made for someone tall (6 feet tall and not for a lifter 6 feet 8 inches tall). Tall lifters should not use an extra wide grip. An extra wide grip strains the wrist with excessive radial flexion. Close and wide grips can make the wrist more prone to injury. Avoid using the thumbless grip. If the bar slips off your hands, it would be disastrous. When being spotted by spotters and by a spotting device the thumbless grip is not as dangerous, but the spotting device has to be very, very solid. The thumbless grips is easier on the wrist and conducts power to the bar more directly (you can lift more). Use chalk with both grips. There are lifters who will use the thumbless grips despite the possible danger. 5. Be sure to have a spotter to help you whenever you lift a heavy weight. You never want to drop the bar on yourself. You also want to be able to max out and be able to recover when you no longer can lift the bar. A spotter will be able to help you recover from your final press. 6. Lift the bar up, slowly bring it down to just above your sternum, and explode upward for one rep. Pay attention to your form as you add more weight. It's easier to bend your wrists, bounce the weight off your chest, and exhibit other \"no-nos\" when trying to lift big. You'll gain more muscle and strength lifting the right form and lower weight than you will lifting with higher weight and the wrong form. Lifters generally do between 8 and 12 reps (also called \"repetitions\") and 3 to six sets (one set is the maximum numbers of reps you give yourself). 7. Drink plenty of water and take at least two minute breaks between each set. Water will help you stay hydrated and allow your muscles to function at high capacity, giving you an overall better workout. 8. Rest according to how you feel between sets. Some guides say the ideal rest time between sets is 90 to 120 seconds. While this is perhaps a good general guide for increasing muscle mass, it may not be ideal for you as an individual. You probably don't want to overshoot the 2-3 minute range, but you don't want to rush yourself into lifting thin. If your ultimate goal is gaining muscle and mass, you're going to want to shock your body. How you do this is up to you. It can mean cutting down on rest time, increasing poundage on lifts, supersetting, etc. As long as you manage to keep pushing your body physically, you will notice a difference.",

    "question": "How to Do a Cartwheel? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Picture an imaginary line extending straight in front of you. Use this line as a guide while you perform your cartwheel. You can even use painter’s tape to create a real line across a carpet or a mat . Make this line several feet long. Try to stay on the line, as if the line is a balance beam. As you focus on the line, be sure to keep your form in mind, too. Make sure the area around your line is free and clear. Avoid practicing cartwheels near walls or pieces of furniture that you might run into. Injuries occur when you bump into something hard. Stretch your arms and legs before practicing a cartwheel. This helps to stretch out your muscles and reduces the risk of injury. 2. Lunge forward with your lead leg and raise your arms. Slightly bend your front leg at the knee and keep your back leg straight. Keep both feet pointing forward parallel to your imaginary line. Hold your arms straight up by your ears. A common mistake is to start a cartwheel while facing sideways. Make sure you’re facing forwards as you prepare and start for your cartwheel. That is the correct way. Either leg can be your lead leg. Sometimes, however, it's more comfortable to use one leg instead of the other—you can try to figure out which one by doing a series of handstands, some starting with your right leg in front, others with your left. Whichever leading leg feels more natural is the one you should use for your cartwheel.You can determine your leading by watching which leg in splits feels more comfortable. 3. Lower your arms towards the ground while raising your back leg. Keep your arms straight by your ears as you lower them down to bring your head and torso down as well. Only lower your arms about halfway to the ground. Bring your back leg up while keeping it straight so your body forms a “T” shape. This step requires balance. You may need to drop your leg several times before you find a balanced position you can hold. Don’t worry if you’re having trouble balancing. Once you get the hang of the cartwheel, you won’t have to hold this position for very long since it will all become one continuous and natural movement. 4. Place your hands on the mat as you turn your body sideways. Put down the arm on the same side of your body as your lead leg first. Then put your other arm down so they're spread about shoulder width apart, similar to the way they would be positioned for a handstand. Place both hands along the imaginary line. Think \"hand hand feet\" to help you process the cartwheel. For example, if you lunged with your right leg, place your right hand down first, then your left hand. Keep the fingers of each hand pointing away from your head. 5. Push off on your front leg, then bring your legs up in a V shape. Straighten your front leg as you push so your legs end up in the air, pointing straight upwards. Balance your weight on your arms with your hands shoulder-width apart on either side of your head. Keep your head and torso upside down and positioned directly over your arms. Use your shoulders and core for support. You won’t hold this position for long. Cartwheels should be performed in one fluid motion. Make sure to keep your legs straight the whole time. If you are a beginner, then you may want to practice more. 6. Lower your lead leg as you lift the first hand you put down off the mat. To complete the cartwheel, put your leading leg down first along your imaginary line. The first hand you placed on the mat will lift up naturally as your foot comes down. Bring your arm up by your ear to finish the cartwheel. Your weight should start to shift onto your legs. Keep your head and torso roughly parallel to the mat. 7. Bring your other leg down while lifting your other hand off the mat. Your other leg will follow the first as it comes down. Make sure to place your back foot behind your leading foot along the same imaginary line so both feet point back in the direction you came from. Your second hand will lift naturally off the mat, following the first hand. At this point, both your head and torso should be right side up, centered over your legs. A common mistake while cartwheeling is leaving your hands on the ground for too long. Make sure that your arms stay straight and by your ears as your chest and head come up at the end of the cartwheel. 8. Land in a lunge facing in the opposite direction. Position yourself so your original back leg is in front and slightly bent, while your original leading leg is behind you and straight, just like a lunge. Keep both feet pointing in the direction you came from. Make sure your arms are straight and pointing upwards, next to your ears. Position your torso in the same direction your feet are pointing.",

    "question": "How to perform a deadlift with proper form? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Prepare the barbell. Place the barbell on the ground in front of you and add plates according to your strength and fitness level. If it is your first time performing the deadlift, start lighter. It is always easy to add weight later. You want to perfect your form before you test your physical limits. Secure the plates tightly onto the barbell with clips to keep them from slipping around. Beginners usually start lifting just the barbell, since a typical barbell weighs between 25 and 45 pounds on its own. In this case, you'll want to prop the bar up so it's as high on your shins as it would be if it had plates (approximately 6-8 inches). Otherwise, you'll be bending too far down to pull the barbell right off the floor and could injure yourself. When you prop the barbell, be carefully that it can't easily roll off. 2. Set your stance. Step up to the bar so that your feet are approximately shoulder width apart, your toes are pointing forward or slightly outward, and the barbell is at the midpoint of your foot (as if it's dividing the front and the back of your feet in half). 3. Sit back. Pretend there's a short stool behind you; bend your knees and hips and sit back as if you were going to sit on that stool, while you reach down to grab onto the barbell (hands shoulder-width apart). Actively push your knees out; don't let them collapse in. Keep your back straight so your spine is in a neutral position parallel to the floor. Hinge forward from your hips instead of bending from the waist. [1] X Expert Source Melody Sayers, MS, RD, NASM-CPT Registered Dietician & Personal Trainer Expert Interview Bend your knees and hips just enough to reach and grab onto the bar. This is the starting position for the deadlift. Your shins should be pretty vertical and touching the bar. This is a hard position to stay in. As you figure out your form and check all these criteria, sometimes you'll straighten your legs and allow your back to curve to take a little break from this position. If you watch people deadlift, you'll see them do this between deadlifts. Just make sure you get back into this position before you actually lift. 4. Check your grip. Grasp the barbell with your hands slightly more than shoulder width apart, just outside of your legs. Keep your arms straight. Your palms should face your body, and be equally far from the ends of the barbell. It's not uncommon for people to use a mixed grip as they move onto heavier weights, as it affords a stronger grip, but it's generally better to keep things simple as a beginner. For Olympic lifting, some people use the hook grip, which is more secure but is painful at first. It is similar to the overhand grip, except that instead of the thumb over the remaining fingers, it is hooked underneath them. The underhand grip alone is not recommended because it can lead to the rupture of bicep muscle and connecting tendons, especially in people who do not have full flexibility in the elbow joint. 5. Set your starting position. \"Setting\" here means creating tension in your body while you're in the starting position so you use your muscles when you pull the bar up. It's a bit like clenching your body; you don't want to be like a wet noodle at all because then you might pull a muscle or hurt a joint. Always make sure your back is completely flat and straight. Keep your head, shoulders, and back in alignment. [2] X Expert Source Melody Sayers, MS, RD, NASM-CPT Registered Dietician & Personal Trainer Expert Interview If there is any kind of bend in your back, you need to do some flexibility work before deadlifting. If you have someone record you in starting position, you'll be able to see whether your back is straight or not. Your hips should be above your knees and your shoulders should be above the hips while slightly over the bar. Engage your core and keep your weight heavy in your heels. [3] X Expert Source Melody Sayers, MS, RD, NASM-CPT Registered Dietician & Personal Trainer Expert Interview Make sure you are looking at the ground in front of you (about 45 degrees) to avoid strain on your neck when performing the lifting portion of the deadlift. 6. Stand up and bring the bar up with you. Raise your hips and shoulders at the same rate while maintaining a flat back. Keep your abs tight during the whole lift. Begin the movement by lifting the slack out of the bar. This is done by pulling the bar slightly up until you feel resistance. If you are using metal plates, you will hear a slight clanging noise. This engages all of the muscles prior to committing to the lift. Next, lift the weight while pushing through the middle of your foot, straightening your knees while pulling your shoulders and head back, and pushing your hips forward after the bar has reached just below the knee. The bar should drag along your shins on the way up--that's why a lot of people who deadlift wear pants or knee-high socks, and if they don't, they often have bruises or scrapes to show for it. Come to a standing position with upright posture and your shoulders pulled back (don't let your shoulders cave forward, think of always pinching your shoulders back together and sticking your chest up and out). Don't bend backwards at all, just stand up straight. Engage (squeeze) your hamstrings and glutes to pull the bar up. Avoid locking your knees. [4] X Expert Source Melody Sayers, MS, RD, NASM-CPT Registered Dietician & Personal Trainer Expert Interview 7. Lower the bar. Keeping your back straight, return the bar to the starting position in a controlled manner. Push your butt out as if you are going to sit down in a chair. Do not arch your back or curl your tailbone under. [5] X Expert Source Melody Sayers, MS, RD, NASM-CPT Registered Dietician & Personal Trainer Expert Interview Release the weight after it is on the ground. 8. Place two dumbbells on either side of your body. The dumbbells should be slightly in front of your feet. Make sure that the weight of your dumbbells is appropriate for your strength. 9. Position yourself properly. Your feet should be spread slightly wider than your shoulders. Point your toes forward. You could also point them slightly outward; the result will be the same. 10. Squat down and grasp the dumbbells. You should squat with a flat, neutral back. Make sure that your shoulders are pulled away from your ears. Keep your head in line with your spine, though if it more comfortable you can tilt your chin up slightly. Make sure that your gaze remains straight ahead (if your eyes wander, so will your head, which will in turn shift your spine.) Make sure that your chest is lifted. Make sure that your heels stay firmly on the floor, and that your shoulders are slightly in front of the balls of your feet. 11. Keep your core strong while you stand up. Your abs help stabilize your spine when you begin to lift the dumbbells. Straighten your knees and then your hips before coming to a fully upright position. Your elbows should be straight and the dumbbells should rest by your sides against your thighs. Your hips and shoulders should rise up and straighten at the same time. You should try to keep the dumbbells as close to your body as possible while you straighten up. 12. Hinge at the knees to lower the dumbbells back down. Your hips should move backwards and down as you begin to squat back down to the ground. Try to avoid bending your knees so that they are far ahead of your toes. Keep your back straight and avoid curling your tailbone in or arching your back. Make sure to keep your abs strong and engaged while you lower back down. Keep your shoulders back and lowered while you do this lift and squat.",

    "question": "How to do a side plank? Show visual steps for alignment.",
    "reference_text": "1. Lie on your right side on a yoga mat. You’ll be putting your weight on your feet and your elbow, so you’ll want something soft beneath you. Spread out so you’re lying on your right side on the floor. If you don’t have a yoga mat, try to do this exercise on carpet or a rug so you have a little bit of cushion beneath you. 2. Put your left foot on top of your right foot. Stick your legs straight out so they’re in line with your glutes, then stack your feet on top of each other. This will help you keep your body straight, so it’s super important! Your feet will be anchoring you to the ground, so it’s really important they stay steady throughout this exercise. 3. Push your right elbow underneath your right armpit. Spread your palm out wide to keep your balance. Your arm will be taking most of your weight, so really dig it into the floor to keep your balance. Make sure your right arm stays at a 90-degree angle from your torso the entire time. 4. Engage your core to lift your hips off the ground. To get into the plank position, squeeze your abs and your glutes tight. Lift your hips up off the ground until your body creates a slanted line from your head down to your feet. If you’re having trouble keeping your balance, place your left hand on your hip. Otherwise, keep it flat along your left side. Keep your hips in a straight line with the rest of your body—don't lift them up or let them sink down. [5] X Expert Source Laila Ajani Fitness Trainer Expert Interview 5. Hold the pose for 6 seconds, then lower your hips. When you’re first starting out, this pose might be tough to hold. Try to go for at least 6 seconds, then slowly lower your hips back to the floor. As you get better, you can try holding your side plank for up to 30 seconds at a time. If you’re having trouble, try exhaling as you lift your hips up and inhaling as you lower down. This will help you engage the right muscles so you can hold the pose for longer. 6. Repeat that 3 to 5 times, then switch to your left side. As you practice this more, you’ll be able to do more reps. When you first start out, try to do the pose 3 to 5 times, then roll over onto your left side and repeat. If you don’t feel exhausted by these reps, you can try doing a few more. On the left side, your left arm and left foot will be underneath your body. 7. Bend your knees if you’re a beginner. If you find the normal side plank to be a little too tough, get into a side plank position, but bend your knees to stick your feet out behind you. Engage your glutes to lift your hips off the floor, and use your knees instead of your feet to keep your balance. [9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source This is a good way to practice the side plank if you’re having trouble keeping your back straight. 8. Do leg raises to engage your obliques. Get into a normal side plank position. Keeping your spine straight, lift your top leg up toward the ceiling, taking it a little bit higher than hip height. Quickly lower your leg back down to complete one repetition. If you’re having trouble keeping your balance, place your outside hand on your hip to keep yourself steady. To really challenge yourself, try holding a dumbbell in your upper hand as you do your leg lifts. Try doing leg lifts 10 to 15 times on each side. 9. Try hip dips to strengthen your lower obliques. Get into a side plank position, then place your left hand on your hip. Slowly lower your hips down toward the floor, stopping just before they touch the ground. Quickly engage your abs to lift your hips back up again for one repetition. You’ll feel this in your abs, your glutes, and your obliques. It’s important to raise back up into a classic side plank position with your spine straight. That way, you won’t lose your posture throughout the exercise. If you’re having trouble with this exercise, do a side plank on your knees and try hip dips that way. Try doing hip dips for 15 to 30 seconds on each side. 10. Do a side plank crunch to work on your abs. Get into a side plank position and lift your hips up off the ground. Pull your upper leg and upper arm in towards your torso to do a crunch on that side of your body. Extend your arm and leg outwards to get out of the crunch and complete one repetition. If you feel yourself starting to rock back and forth, engage your glutes to hold yourself steady. Picture this like you’re doing a classic crunch, except now you’re on your side. Start out by doing crunches for 15 to 30 seconds on each side. 11. Work on your balance with an oblique twist. Lie on your side in a side plank position. Lift your hips off the ground, then put your outer hand up by your ear. Slowly turn in toward the floor, stopping yourself when you’re looking directly at your lower forearm. Twist back around to get into your side plank position. These twists engage your entire body, so they’re a great overall workout. Twist 10 to 15 times on each side. 12. Try a side plank slide to challenge yourself. Get into a side plank position. Slowly slide your feet outwards, keeping your spine straight and your weight on your elbow. Tilt your arm so it’s at an angle to work your obliques, then hold the pose for a few seconds. Engage your obliques to slide back upwards into a normal side plank. This move can be a little tough on your elbow, so put a pillow or a foam mat underneath your arm if you need to. Try to keep your spine straight the entire time to get the most out of this workout. Work up to doing slides for 15 to 30 seconds on each side.",

    "reference_text": "1. Lie on your back on top of an exercise mat . Find a comfortable spot to lie down on the floor where you can spread out. Keep your neck and back in line. Tighten your abs and push your lower back flat against the mat the entire time you’re performing crunches to ensure your core stays engaged. If you don’t have an exercise mat, then lay out a soft towel or do crunches on a carpeted floor so you’re more comfortable. 2. Bend your knees so your feet are flat on the floor. Position your feet so your heels are about 12 to 18 in (30 to 46 cm) from your tailbone. Bend your knees to 90 degrees and keep them about hip-width apart. Make sure the soles of your feet are flat against the ground. 3. Cross your arms in front of your chest with your hands just below your shoulders. Keep your elbows pointed down toward your feet. Lay your hands flat on your chest right in front of your shoulders. Avoid putting your hands behind your head since you could accidentally strain your neck when you perform your exercise. For more resistance during your workout, hold a 5 to 10 pounds (2.3 to 4.5 kg) plate weight over your chest. 4. Lift your shoulder blades off of the mat with a smooth, controlled motion. Tighten your abs and take a deep breath in. As you exhale, engage your muscles to raise your torso off of the mat all while keeping your lower back and feet flat on the floor. Lift yourself just enough to get your shoulder blades off of the floor. Support yourself in this position for 1–2 seconds. Avoid sitting all the way up when you perform a crunch since muscles in your back and hips will take over, and you could strain yourself. Keep your lower back, tailbone, and feet in contact with the mat at all times. If your feet lift off of the ground while you’re performing a rep, have someone hold onto your feet or position them underneath something heavy. Keep your neck relaxed instead of tucking in your chin. Try to keep an apple-sized space between your chin and your chest. Looking at the ceiling can help keep you from curling your neck too much. 5. Lower yourself back down with a slow, steady motion. Gently inhale as you slowly lower your torso down to the floor. Use a smooth, controlled motion to work your ab muscles and prevent you from injuring yourself. Take a brief pause to finish 1 rep. If you rush into the next rep, you’ll end up using the momentum of your body moving instead of your muscles to lift yourself up. Additionally, you’re more likely to injure your back Try doing a set of 10–12 crunches to start working out your abs . As you start building up your core strength, try doing 2–3 sets or increasing the number of reps you do.",

Set up\n\n* Lie on your **right side** on a mat.\n* Bend knees about **90°** and stack hips, knees, and ankles.\n* Right forearm on the floor for balance; **left hand** lightly behind your head (don’t pull your neck).\n* Keep ribs “down” and neck neutral.\n\n2. Brace\n\n* Take a breath in.\n* Gently **brace your core** as if preparing for a light poke, keeping hips stacked and elbow open.\n\n3. Crunch up\n\n* **Exhale** and bring your **left ribcage toward your left hip**.\n* Lift both shoulders a few inches; keep elbow wide and gaze forward.\n* Knees and legs stay quiet—movement comes from your **obliques**, not from tugging the head.\n\n4. Pause\n\n* Hold the top position for **1 second**, keep breathing softly, feel the side squeeze.\n\n5. Lower with control\n\n* **Inhale** and lower your shoulders back to the start without collapsing. Maintain tension.\n\n6. Repeat & switch sides\n\n* Do **8–15 controlled reps**, then **flip to your left side** to work the right obliques.\n* Aim for **2–3 sets per side**.\n\n### Form tips & common mistakes\n\n* Keep hips stacked; don’t roll backward.\n* Don’t yank on your head—your hand just supports.\n* Small range is fine; prioritize **slow, controlled** reps.\n* If you feel your neck more than your side, reduce range and press your tongue lightly to the roof of your mouth to help stabilize.\n\n### Make it easier\n\n* Place top hand across your chest instead of behind your head.\n* Keep bottom arm straight and use it lightly on the floor for balance.\n\n### Make it harder\n\n* Straighten your legs and keep feet slightly off the floor.\n* Add a light dumbbell or small plate held against the side of your ribcage (still no neck pulling).\n\nIf you want variations (e.g., **side plank crunch** or **standing side crunch**), say the word and I’ll add those too.\n",
