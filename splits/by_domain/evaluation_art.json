Draw a curve above each eye with an oval in the middle. 3. 3. Add a line underneath the nose, then sketch a hook shape on either side. 4. 4. Draw a curve underneath the cartoon puppy face's mouth. 5. 5. Sketch a curve on either side of the face. 6. 6. Draw a rectangle with rounded edges to outline the head. 7. 7. Outline an oval for the right ear. Make sure the oval is behind the face. 8. 8. Repeat the previous step for the left ear. 9. 9. Use a wavy shape to draw a patch around your puppy face's eye. Finally, outline your easy dog face with black. Use thick lines for most of the drawing and a thin line for the patch. If you like, add a dog biscuit to give your dog a treat. 10. You can fill in your easy dog face with any color, but this guide recommends using tan for the face and dark brown for the ears, nose and patch. Leave the eyes white, and add a white highlight to the nose.",

Clean outline\n   Trace the circle cleanly (keep guidelines faint so you can erase them later).\n\n3. Eyes\n   Place two big oval eyes on the horizontal guideline, spaced about one eye-width apart. Add tiny highlights (white dots) to make them lively.\n\n4. Nose & muzzle\n   Under the eye line, draw a small upside-down triangle nose. From the sides of the nose, curve two lines down and around to form a soft “W” for the cheeks and a small smile. Add a little tongue if you like.\n\n5. Ears\n   Add two floppy, rounded triangle ears attached near the top sides of the head.\n\n6. Details\n   Add short eyebrow curves above the eyes, a small chin line, and three tiny whisker dots on each cheek (optional).\n\n7. Refine the smile\n   Thicken the mouth line slightly and round the cheeks so it looks friendly. Erase the guidelines.\n\n8. Finish\n   Add a collar and tag under the chin if desired. You can also add a patch around one eye or a few spots. Ink your final lines and color if you want.\n\nTips:\n\n* Keep everything round and soft for a cute look.\n* If you want a different breed vibe, change the ear shape (pointy for a husky, long and thin for a hound).\n* Eyes higher = younger/cuter; eyes lower = older/goofier.\n\nIf you want, I can also make a printable worksheet version.\n",

Then, Use a series of connected curved lines to draw the bushes and trees visible in the distance. 2. 2. Draw more shrubbery on the horizon using a series of connected curved lines. Then, draw a tree towering above the rest. Extend a pair of lines for the trunk, and use a curved line to enclose the tree's crown. 3. 3. Draw more trees on the horizon. Again, extend a pair of lines for the trunk, and use a curved line to enclose the tree's crown. 4. 4. Draw two large \"U\" shaped lines to outline the rainbow. Draw the sun peeking out from behind it. Use a curved line to enclose the partial circle at the center of the sun. Then, use a series of straight lines that meet at points to draw its zig zag-shaped rays. 5. 5. Draw \"U\" shaped lines within the rainbow, parallel to the outer lines, to demarcate the different colors. Then draw a daisy flower growing on the hillside. Start with an oval for the center of the flower, and \"U\" shaped lines for the petals. Draw a line below it to form the stem and a teardrop-shaped leaf on one side. 6. 6. Draw another daisy on the hillside. Again, start with an oval for the center of the flower, and \"U\" shaped lines for the petals. Nearby, draw a tulip using curved lines. Draw a line below each flower to form the stem, and a teardrop-shaped leaf on one side. 7. 7. Draw more tulips and daisies. Again, use an oval and \"U\" shaped lines for the daisy and curved lines for the tulip. Then, draw a line below each flower to form the stem and a teardrop-shaped leaf on one side. 8. 8. Draw another tulip, then some butterflies fluttering about. Use \"U\" shaped lines to form each of the butterflies' four wings. 9. 9. Complete your rainbow for kids outline by drawing clouds in the sky. Use a straight line for the bottom of each cloud and a series of curved lines for the fluffy top. 10.

At the end of the snout, draw a circle. This is the dog’s nose. Use curved lines to trace the side of the dog’s face and his forehead. Above the eyes, use curved lines to enclose the pointed eyebrows 3. 3. Draw the dog’s open, smiling mouth. Below the nose, draw a wide, curved “W” shaped line. Let it meet the nose on one side. On the other, extend the arm of the “W” all the way to the corner of the mouth. Below this, use curved lines to outline the lower jaw, the inside of the mouth, and the tongue. Contour the corner of the mouth with short lines. At the front of the snout, draw two small, triangular teeth. 4. 4. Use curved lines to enclose the rounded shapes of the dog’s ears. Then, use long curved lines to trace the top of the head, neck, and side of the body. 5. 5. Extend a long curved line below the lower jaw to form the chest. Then, use a pair of long curved lines to draw the leg. At the bottom, use overlapping curved lines to create the toes and enclose the paw. 6. 6. Contour the chest with a curved line and draw the remaining front leg. Again, use curved lines. Those at the toes should overlap. 7. 7. Draw the rear leg, bent into a sitting position, using curved lines. Again the toes should utilize overlapping curved lines. 8. 8. Draw the remaining leg of the sitting dog. Use curved lines for the back, the bent leg, and the round paw. Band the paw with short lines. 9. 9. Complete your dog cartoon outline by drawing his wagging tail. Extend two curved lines from the dog’s hip and allow them to meet at a sharp point. Beside the tail, sketch a hatch mark pattern using curved lines to simulate the motion of the tail. 10.

Add tiny white circles for highlights and fill the pupils around them. Two small curved dashes above each eye make friendly brows.\n\nBody shape\nUnder the head, draw a wide “U” shape for the chest/body.

Add a short horizontal line beneath each for the wrist opening.\n\n2. Cuffs\n   Turn each wrist line into a short “cuff cylinder”: draw a thin rectangle wrapping the base of each oval.\n\n3. Knuckle dome\n   Round the top of each oval into a smooth dome. Add a soft, shallow curve near the top front to suggest the knuckle ridge.\n\n4. Thumbs\n   On the inner side of each glove, attach a teardrop/bean shape for the thumb pad. Its tip points toward the knuckle ridge; its base connects near the cuff.\n\n5. Palm panel\n   Inside each glove, sketch a curved panel that starts under the thumb, swoops across the palm, and meets the cuff—this is the padded palm section.\n\n6. Clean silhouette\n   Trace a single confident outline around each glove (dome → front knuckle → thumb → palm → cuff). Erase construction lines.\n\n7. Details & seams\n   Add short dashed or stitched lines along the knuckle ridge, around the thumb base, and near the cuff edge. If you prefer laces, sketch a narrow opening on the front of one glove with an “X-X-X” lace pattern; otherwise add a simple strap rectangle.\n\n8. Overlap & depth\n   Decide which glove sits slightly forward. Thicken that glove’s outer contour a bit more and let it overlap the other to create depth.\n\n9. Shading\n   Pick a light source (e.g., top-left). Lightly shade the underside of the knuckle dome, the inner thumb curve, and the gap between gloves. Darken the cuff underside. Keep the top planes lighter.\n\n10. Highlights\n    Leave slim unshaded arcs along the upper knuckle and thumb to suggest glossy padding.\n\n11. Final linework\n    Go over the main contour with a steady, slightly thicker line; keep stitching and fold lines thinner so they read as surface detail.\n\n12. Color (optional)\n    Fill the gloves with a base color (classic red works well). Add a darker tone along the shaded edges and a lighter tint on top planes. Keep cuffs a touch darker than the glove body.\n\nWant the steps as a printable handout or in a different style (cartoon, realistic, vintage)? I can format that too.\n",

Use overlapping curved lines to sketch the trunk, mouth, and jaw. Notice the tusk overlapping the trunk. To draw the tusk, extend a curved line from just in front of the mouth and double it back upon itself. 3. 3. Complete the trunk using a long curved line. Note the “C” shape of the prehensile tip of the trunk. Then, enclose the ear using a long curved line. 4. 4. Enclose the remaining ear and trunk, using a curved line for each. Detail the ears with curved lines, and use another curved line to begin sketching the elephant’s chest. 5. 5. Draw the foreleg. Use a pair of roughly parallel curved lines that form a loose zigzag shape. Connect them at the bottom with a curved line. Use “U” shaped lines to indicate the toenails. 6. 6. Draw the rear leg. Again, use a pair of curved lines and connect them at the bottom. Detail the toes with “U” shaped lines. Connect the tops of each leg with a curved line, forming the belly. 7. 7. Draw the remaining foreleg. Use curved lines and connect them at the bottom. Then, extend a long curved line from the ear to the top of the rear leg to enclose the body. Detail the shoulder and hip with curved lines. 8. 8. Use a curved line to enclose the remaining rear leg, partially hidden behind the first. Draw the toenails on both the front and rear legs. Extend two curved lines from the back of the body and allow them to meet at a point, forming the tail. 9. 9. Use curved lines that meet at jagged points to enclose a tuft of hair at the tip. 10.

Erase guide lines as necessary. This forms the watermelon's stem. 3. 3. Draw two sets of wavy lines extending downward from the stem. Allow one to reach the opposite side of the watermelon. For the other pair, allow the lines to meet in a sharp point. These form the first of the watermelon's characteristic stripes. 4. 4. Draw two more stripes. Extend one set of lines down from the stem, the other up from the bottom of the melon. Allow each to end in a sharp point. 5. 5. Draw more stripes across the watermelon, filling the empty spaces. 6. 6. Next, you will draw a slice of cut watermelon. Draw a wide \"U\" shaped line, allowing it to overlap the completed watermelon. Then, connect the ends of the \"U\" using a straight line. 7. 7. Give the slice a three dimensional shape by drawing a curved line from one corner of the shape to the bottom of the shape. 8. 8. Erase the guide lines from behind the watermelon slice. 9. 9. Detail the inside of the slice. Draw a curved line parallel to the original \"U\" shaped line. This separates the green and flavorless rind from the sweet, pink fruit. Then, draw seeds. Use a teardrop shape for each seed.

The outside of the watermelon is typically striped in shades of green. The center of the melon is often pink, red, orange, or yellow.",

This is the overall slice.\n\n**Step 2 — Rind band**\nInside the arc, add a second, smaller arc that follows the first one. Leave a thin gap between them—this gap is the light-green rind.\n\n**Step 3 — Clean the edges**\nRound the two corners where the arc meets the bottom edge so the slice looks soft and juicy.\n\n**Step 4 — First seeds**\nPlace 5–7 small teardrop shapes across the pulp. Point the narrow ends toward the center.\n\n**Step 5 — Seed variety**\nAdd a few tiny dots or smaller seeds between the larger ones to make it feel natural.\n\n**Step 6 — Base colors**\nColor the pulp a bright red/pink. Fill the rind band a light green and the very outer edge a darker green. Color the seeds black.\n\n**Step 7 — Shading**\nDeepen the red slightly near the rind for a subtle gradient. Add a light, soft shadow under the slice so it sits on the page.\n\n**Step 8 — Highlights & finish**\nAdd tiny white glints on a few seeds and along the top curve. Thicken the outer outline a touch for a bold, finished look.\n\n**Optional tweaks**\n\n* Add a small “bite” notch on the top curve and adjust the seeds around it.\n* Sprinkle a couple of pale freckles on the pulp for texture.\n* Turn it into a wedge on a plate by sketching a thin oval and resting the slice on it.\n\nWant a version with fewer or more steps (e.g., a 4-step kid-friendly version)? I can spin that up too.\n",

Continue using long curved lines to enclose rounded ribs until the pumpkin has a round, full shape. 3. 3. Draw the pumpkin's thick stem. Extend two curved lines from the top of the pumpkin. From each of these, draw a long curved line. The lines should be roughly parallel and \"S\" shaped. 4. 4. Use a curved line to enclose the end of the stem. Draw another curved line across it to give the tip of the stem an oval shape. Then, texture the stem with curved lines. Use additional short lines to begin enclosing the ribs visible behind the stem. 5. 5. Complete the pumpkin's ribs. Then, draw tendrils of vine terminating from the stem. Use long, curving, \"S\" shaped lines. 6. 6. Draw a leaf along the pumpkin vine. First, extend a curved line from the vine. This forms the leaf's stem and vein. Then, use a series of connected, curved lines to outline the body of the leaf. 7. 7. Continue to draw the body of the leaf on the opposite side of the vein. Then, draw secondary veins extending from the primary vein or midrib. 8. 8. Draw the remaining veins, and begin a second leaf. Again, use a curved line for the stem and a series of curved lines to sketch the outline of the leaf. 9. 9. Complete the leaf, erasing as necessary. Finish outlining the leaf, and draw the secondary veins. 10. Color your pumpkin. Traditionally, pumpkins are orange in color. They can also be yellow, brown, green, or white!",

This forms the top of the aquarium and gives it a three-dimensional appearance. 2. 2. Begin creating the underwater scene . Draw small, round, irregular shapes in one corner to indicate a pile of pebbles. Then, draw a wavy curved line along the bottom of the tank, forming the ground or sediment. From the back corners of the trapezoid, extend vertical straight lines. These indicate the back corners of the aquarium. Notice that they don't go all the way down; the empty spaces will soon be filled with other objects. 3. 3. Draw the base of the aquarium. Use straight lines to draw the tops of the sides and the sides and bottom of the front. Then, draw a straight, horizontal line across the top of the base. 4. 4. Next, draw a castle for the fish to hide in. For the turret or tower, start with the triangle-shaped roof. Then, use curved lines for the sides, midsection, and the \"U\" shaped windows. Use curved lines to draw the central section of the castle, noting the large \"U\" shaped door. Texture the castle with full and partial rectangles, simulating bricks. 5. 5. Draw a watchtower at the top of the castle. Use small trapezoids to create the raised sections of the parapet. Connect them with curved lines, fully enclosing the castle. Then, begin drawing coral. Use curved lines to enclose the branching, tree-like shape. Finally, sketch sand along the side of the aquarium using a curved line. 6. 6. Complete the coral, using curved lines. Texture it with small \"C\" shaped lines. Then, draw the sediment at the back and side of the fish tank using a long curved line. 7. 7. Draw a plant or seaweed. For each leaf, extend two curved lines upward from the sediment. Allow them to cross back and forth over one another, enclosing several segments, before they finally meet at a point. Use curved lines to enclose and texture a seashell , as well as texturing the sand. 8. 8. Introduce the fish into their new home! Use curved lines to sketch the fish's mouth, eye, pectoral fin, body, tail, and dorsal fin. Texture the fins with curved lines. Then, draw a few circular bubbles so that the fish has plenty of air to breathe. 9. 9. Complete your fish tank outline by drawing the final fish. Follow the same steps as with the previous fish. Enclose a few more bubbles, then use wavy lines to sketch a rectangular shape at the top of the tank. This is the waterline. 10. Color your cartoon aquarium.

Draw the box\n\n* Lightly sketch a rectangle for the front.\n* Add a slightly offset rectangle behind it.\n* Connect the corners to make a clear, 3-D tank.\n\n2. Define glass edges\n\n* Darken the outer edges you want visible.\n* Keep the far back edges lighter or dashed so it still reads as glass.\n\n3. Add the waterline\n\n* Draw a horizontal line a bit below the top rim, slightly wavy for realism.\n* Show the line on the side planes too so it wraps around in 3-D.\n\n4. Pour in substrate\n\n* From the bottom back corner, sketch a gentle mound toward the front.\n* Keep edges soft; it’s sand or gravel.\n\n5. Place hardscape\n\n* Add a few smooth rocks (ovals) and a piece of driftwood (bent cylinder).\n* Overlap shapes to create depth.\n\n6. Plant it\n\n* Draw simple leaf clusters: long tapered leaves for vallisneria; bushy ovals for small plants.\n* Vary heights and angles.\n\n7. Add a fish\n\n* Start with an almond/teardrop body, triangle tail, small dorsal and pelvic fins.\n* Place one fish near the middle so it’s easy to see. Add a tiny circle eye and a small mouth.\n\n8. Equipment & bubbles\n\n* Sketch a heater or filter as a slim rectangle on a back corner.\n* Add a few bubbles rising from the substrate or filter.\n\n9. Clean-up & line weight\n\n* Erase construction lines that pass through the fish and foreground objects.\n* Thicken the front rim and foreground objects slightly; keep far edges thin.\n\n10. Shine & texture (optional color)\n\n* Add a thin highlight along the front glass edge and a couple of soft vertical streaks.\n* Dot the gravel, add light shading under rocks/plants, and, if coloring, keep water pale blue and glass mostly white with subtle reflections.\n\nWant another version (cartoony, realistic, or top-view aquascape)? I can generate a different visual set too.\n",

    "reference_text": "1. 1. Begin the bracelet outline by drawing a heart. Draw a long curved line inside the heart, parallel to the outline. This gives it a rounded, three-dimensional appearance. Then, draw an oval-shaped bead overlapping the edge of the heart. 2. 2. Draw a smaller circular bead and another oval-shaped bead. Then, begin drawing the flower-shaped bead. Draw a circle for the center of the flower and connected \"U\" shaped lines for its petals. 3. 3. Finish the petals of the flower using \"U\" shaped lines. Then, draw another oval, circle, and oval series of beads. 4. 4. Draw another, smaller heart, then another series of oval, circle, and oval-shaped beads. 5. 5. On the opposite side of the large heart, draw a series of oval, circular, and oval-shaped beads. Then, draw another daisy-shaped bead. Again, use a circle for the center of the flower and connected \"U\" shaped lines for the petals. 6. 6. Beside the flower, draw another series of oval, circle, and oval beads. Then, draw another small heart-shaped bead. 7. 7. Draw a series of oval and circle-shaped beads extending from the heart. After the last oval-shaped bead, draw a circle within a circle. This is part of the bracelet's clasp. 8. 8. Draw an oval within an oval passing through the circle within a circle. Erase as necessary. Then, draw two parallel curved lines entering the oval-shaped portion of the clasp. The lines will form a question mark shape. 9. 9. Use a curved line, doubled back on itself, to form the tip of the question mark shape. At its middle, enclose a bump - the movable arm of the clasp - using a curved line. At its base, draw a circle within a circle. Use another circle within a circle to form the chain link connecting it to the rest of the bracelet. 10. Your bracelet outline is now complete. Don't forget to color it! We've left some of our beads white like pearls, while others are blue, pink, and yellow. The clasp is yellow as if made of gold.",

Define the edge and clean up\n\n   * Connect the near and far sides with short curves so the band looks three-dimensional. Erase extra construction lines.\n\n4. (Optional) Add a charm loop\n\n   * On the lower-right edge, draw a tiny ring or hook where a charm could hang.\n\n5. Switch to a beaded style (if you like)\n\n   * Lightly “walk” small circles around the oval path, spacing them evenly (mark the four compass points first, then fill the gaps).\n\n6. Refine beads\n\n   * Plump each circle, let neighboring beads overlap slightly, and outline cleanly.\n\n7. Shade for volume\n\n   * Pick a light source (top-left works well). On each bead, shade the lower-right, leave a small highlight on the upper-left. Add a soft inner rim shadow if you kept the solid band style instead of beads.\n\n8. Finish details\n\n   * Darken contact shadows between beads, add a subtle cast shadow beneath the bracelet, and draw a tiny charm (heart, star, initial) on the loop if desired.\n\nTips\n\n* Keep ellipses symmetrical by drawing through them a few times before committing.\n* If the bracelet feels too flat, thicken the band or exaggerate bead overlap.\n* For a metal bangle: skip steps 5–6, and add bright edge highlights along the outer rim.\n\nIf you want another visual showing a **chain** or **cuff** version, say the word and I’ll add it.\n",

    "reference_text": "1. 1. Begin the cartoon snail outline by drawing the snail's head. First, draw two circles. These will become the snail's eyes. Draw a curved line across each circle. In the lower half of the circle, draw a pie chart or Pacman shape - a circle with a missing triangular slice. What does a Pacman shape look like, exactly? Check out this Pacman pixel art . Below each eye, extend two curved lines. These are the snail's eyestalks. Then, connect the stalks with an overlapping curved line, contouring the snail's face. 2. 2. Continue the line of the face. This line should be long and wavy, outlining the bottom of the sticky, slimy foot. 3. 3. Draw another wavy line roughly parallel to the foot, allowing the lines to meet at a point. Draw two curved lines across the face, forming the smiling mouth and the chin. Place a short curved line at the corner of the mouth. 4. 4. Extend the remaining side of the head with a long curved line. Double the line back on itself at the end to begin constructing the base of the shell. Connect the tip of the foot to the shell with a curved line. 5. 5. Begin the spiral shape of the snail shell by drawing a large \"C\" shaped line. Connect it to the snail's head with a short line. 6. 6. Continue the line of the shell to enclose the circle. Continue the line past the point of completion to begin the spiral pattern. 7. 7. Continue the spiral-shaped line. 8. 8. Enclose partial circles all along the spiral line. Notice that the circles grow smaller near the inside of the spiral. 9. 9. Fill the snail shell with more circular spots. Color your cartoon snail. We've given ours a green and yellow body with a tan and brown spotted snail. 10. Throughout much of the world, garden snails are usually brown in color. But some snails - especially the ocean and marsh-dwelling snails - have vivid black-and-white patterns or unusually bright colors .",
