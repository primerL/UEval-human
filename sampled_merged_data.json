Add a curve underneath each shape, then draw ovals inside each shape with a circle cut out of the ovals. 2.Draw a curve above each eye with an oval in the middle. 3.Add a line underneath the nose, then sketch a hook shape on either side. 4.Draw a curve underneath the cartoon puppy face's mouth. 5.Sketch a curve on either side of the face. 6.Draw a rectangle with rounded edges to outline the head. 7.Outline an oval for the right ear. Make sure the oval is behind the face. 8.Repeat the previous step for the left ear. 9.Use a wavy shape to draw a patch around your puppy face's eye. Finally, outline your easy dog face with black. Use thick lines for most of the drawing and a thin line for the patch. If you like, add a dog biscuit to give your dog a treat. 10. You can fill in your easy dog face with any color, but this guide recommends using tan for the face and dark brown for the ears, nose and patch. Leave the eyes white, and add a white highlight to the nose.",

Clean outline\n   Trace the circle cleanly (keep guidelines faint so you can erase them later).\n\n3. Eyes\n   Place two big oval eyes on the horizontal guideline, spaced about one eye-width apart. Add tiny highlights (white dots) to make them lively.\n\n4. Nose & muzzle\n   Under the eye line, draw a small upside-down triangle nose. From the sides of the nose, curve two lines down and around to form a soft “W” for the cheeks and a small smile. Add a little tongue if you like.\n\n5. Ears\n   Add two floppy, rounded triangle ears attached near the top sides of the head.\n\n6. Details\n   Add short eyebrow curves above the eyes, a small chin line, and three tiny whisker dots on each cheek (optional).\n\n7. Refine the smile\n   Thicken the mouth line slightly and round the cheeks so it looks friendly. Erase the guidelines.\n\n8. Finish\n   Add a collar and tag under the chin if desired. You can also add a patch around one eye or a few spots. Ink your final lines and color if you want.\n\nTips:\n\n* Keep everything round and soft for a cute look.\n* If you want a different breed vibe, change the ear shape (pointy for a husky, long and thin for a hound).\n* Eyes higher = younger/cuter; eyes lower = older/goofier.\n\nIf you want, I can also make a printable worksheet version.\n",

    "thinking_trace": "I’m setting the resolution to a standard 1024x1024 for the image. I’ll include the steps as simple labels, like \"1\", \"2\", etc., to help connect them with the accompanying text. The tool can handle text in the image, so I’ll make sure everything looks clear and easy to follow! Let’s start with step one: a rounded shape for the muzzle guide.\n\nFor the cartoon dog face, it’ll be an 8-step process. First, draw the head and add the center line. Then, add large eyes and a small nose. Follow that with a W-shaped muzzle, floppy ears, and optional details like tongue and collar. Finish with clean lines and shading. Plus, you can add style variations!\n\nLet’s simplify the drawing process. We’ll maintain uniform proportions like having the eyes spaced one eye apart, ears starting from the top, and a muzzle halfway. I’ll make sure the style is consistent, friendly, and clear. The final prompt will request black line art with no shading until the last panel, keeping it simple and kid-friendly.\n\nI’ll stick to just numbers for the steps in the image, as they specifically asked for visuals. I’ll avoid detailed text, but I’ll make sure the labels remain clear and simple. Just the basics—like step numbers—will keep it clean while corresponding to the text steps.",

Use curved lines to trace the side of the dog’s face and his forehead. Above the eyes, use curved lines to enclose the pointed eyebrows 3.Draw the dog’s open, smiling mouth. Below the nose, draw a wide, curved “W” shaped line. Let it meet the nose on one side. On the other, extend the arm of the “W” all the way to the corner of the mouth. Below this, use curved lines to outline the lower jaw, the inside of the mouth, and the tongue. Contour the corner of the mouth with short lines. At the front of the snout, draw two small, triangular teeth. 4.Use curved lines to enclose the rounded shapes of the dog’s ears. Then, use long curved lines to trace the top of the head, neck, and side of the body. 5.Extend a long curved line below the lower jaw to form the chest. Then, use a pair of long curved lines to draw the leg. At the bottom, use overlapping curved lines to create the toes and enclose the paw. 6.Contour the chest with a curved line and draw the remaining front leg. Again, use curved lines. Those at the toes should overlap. 7.Draw the rear leg, bent into a sitting position, using curved lines. Again the toes should utilize overlapping curved lines. 8.Draw the remaining leg of the sitting dog. Use curved lines for the back, the bent leg, and the round paw. Band the paw with short lines. 9.Complete your dog cartoon outline by drawing his wagging tail. Extend two curved lines from the dog’s hip and allow them to meet at a sharp point. Beside the tail, sketch a hatch mark pattern using curved lines to simulate the motion of the tail. 10. Color your cartoon dog. We’ve shaded ours dark brown like a chocolate labrador dog.",

Keep your lines light until the end—then trace the final outline darker.\n\nYou’ll need: pencil, eraser, black pen/marker, and optional colored pencils/markers.\n\nStep-by-step (8 steps)\n\nHead & muzzle\nDraw a big circle for the head. Lightly add a short vertical guideline. At the bottom of the circle, sketch a small horizontal oval for the muzzle (it overlaps the circle).\n\nEars\nAdd two floppy, teardrop-like ears on the sides of the head. Their tips should hang lower than the midpoint of the head.\n\nNose & smile\nOn the muzzle, draw a small rounded triangle for the nose. From its sides, curve two short lines downward to suggest a smile. Add a wide “U” under the smile for the mouth/tongue.\n\nEyes & brows\nAbove the muzzle, draw two big ovals for eyes. Add tiny white circles for highlights and fill the pupils around them. Two small curved dashes above each eye make friendly brows.\n\nBody shape\nUnder the head, draw a wide “U” shape for the chest/body. Let the head overlap the body slightly (no neck needed).\n\nFront legs & paws\nFrom the body, add two long “U” shapes straight down for the front legs. At the bottom, draw 3 small bumps on each paw to suggest toes.\n\nBack leg & tail\nOn one side, add a “C” shaped curve for the back leg with a small oval paw peeking out. Sketch a short curved tail to one side.\n\nDetails, cleanup & style\nAdd a collar band and tiny tag under the head if you like. Erase extra construction lines. Trace your final outline with thicker, smooth lines. Optional spots/patches and a soft ground shadow under the paws.\n\nQuick coloring guide (optional)\n\nCoat: light brown or cream\n\nEars/patches: slightly darker brown\n\nNose: black; Tongue: pink\n\nCollar: any bright color (e.g., blue)\n\nLeave small white shines in the eyes\n\nProportion tip: Big head + small body + big eyes = instant cute.\nVariation: Try perky ears, a curlier tail, or different spot patterns.",

Since I need to send text and images in separate messages, I'll give the text first, then generate the image, but I can’t include a summary of the image afterward. One step at a time!\n\nIt looks like I need to handle text and image generation carefully together. I should send the text steps first, then generate the image in a separate message. But since the tool calls for an empty message after generating the image, it makes things tricky for including text afterward. I'll try separating them.\n\nI’m thinking about the user request for separate text and image. The instruction says no summary after generating the image, and the tool requires an empty message after it runs. This might mean I can send the text first, then run the image part, but the second message will be empty. It’s not ideal, but it works.\n\nI’m thinking of sending two messages in sequence. The first would be the text steps, and the second involves the image generation, but that second message would be empty. This still keeps everything in the same turn, but yeah, the second message would be empty to comply with the requirement. It’s awkward, but it works.\n\nI’ll first create clear text steps to draw a cartoon dog, with beginner-friendly instructions and simple materials like pencil, eraser, and black pen. The steps will cover basic shapes like a large circle for the head, along with details like floppy ears and a smiling mouth. Then, I'll create an image with a 2x4 grid, step-by-step, in 8 panels—using clean, thick black lines and minimal details.",

Use overlapping curved lines to form the glove's thumb and mitten. Use short curved lines to draw a starburst pattern at the point where the two lines meet. 5.Draw a second oval overlapping the first glove. Erase as necessary. 6.Erase the top of the oval and sketch in a rectangular shape with rounded corners. It should overlap the first glove, so erase as necessary. This forms the wrist of the glove. Then, enclose another rectangular shape within the first. Draw curved lines across the base of the glove to indicate the curvature of the material. 7.Erase the side of the oval. Outline the thumb and mitten of the glove using two overlapping curved lines. Use shorter curved lines to draw a starburst pattern at the point where the two lines meet. Then, draw a curved line from the wrist to this junction, indicating a seam. 8.Draw a circle above the gloves. This will form the hook from which the gloves hang. Draw a \"U\" shaped line above it. Below it, extend two curved lines and double them back upon themselves. Then, draw pairs of lines from the hook to each glove. This represents the string used to hang the gloves. 9.Detail the glove. Draw curved lines across the wrist and side of the glove to indicate wrinkles and seams. 10. Color your boxing gloves. They are typically red.",

Add a short horizontal line beneath each for the wrist opening.\n\n2. Cuffs\n   Turn each wrist line into a short “cuff cylinder”: draw a thin rectangle wrapping the base of each oval.\n\n3. Knuckle dome\n   Round the top of each oval into a smooth dome. Add a soft, shallow curve near the top front to suggest the knuckle ridge.\n\n4. Thumbs\n   On the inner side of each glove, attach a teardrop/bean shape for the thumb pad. Its tip points toward the knuckle ridge; its base connects near the cuff.\n\n5. Palm panel\n   Inside each glove, sketch a curved panel that starts under the thumb, swoops across the palm, and meets the cuff—this is the padded palm section.\n\n6. Clean silhouette\n   Trace a single confident outline around each glove (dome → front knuckle → thumb → palm → cuff). Erase construction lines.\n\n7. Details & seams\n   Add short dashed or stitched lines along the knuckle ridge, around the thumb base, and near the cuff edge. If you prefer laces, sketch a narrow opening on the front of one glove with an “X-X-X” lace pattern; otherwise add a simple strap rectangle.\n\n8. Overlap & depth\n   Decide which glove sits slightly forward. Thicken that glove’s outer contour a bit more and let it overlap the other to create depth.\n\n9. Shading\n   Pick a light source (e.g., top-left). Lightly shade the underside of the knuckle dome, the inner thumb curve, and the gap between gloves. Darken the cuff underside. Keep the top planes lighter.\n\n10. Highlights\n    Leave slim unshaded arcs along the upper knuckle and thumb to suggest glossy padding.\n\n11. Final linework\n    Go over the main contour with a steady, slightly thicker line; keep stitching and fold lines thinner so they read as surface detail.\n\n12. Color (optional)\n    Fill the gloves with a base color (classic red works well). Add a darker tone along the shaded edges and a lighter tint on top planes. Keep cuffs a touch darker than the glove body.\n\nWant the steps as a printable handout or in a different style (cartoon, realistic, vintage)? I can format that too.\n",

To draw the tusk, extend a curved line from just in front of the mouth and double it back upon itself. 3.Complete the trunk using a long curved line. Note the “C” shape of the prehensile tip of the trunk. Then, enclose the ear using a long curved line. 4.Enclose the remaining ear and trunk, using a curved line for each. Detail the ears with curved lines, and use another curved line to begin sketching the elephant’s chest. 5.Draw the foreleg. Use a pair of roughly parallel curved lines that form a loose zigzag shape. Connect them at the bottom with a curved line. Use “U” shaped lines to indicate the toenails. 6.Draw the rear leg. Again, use a pair of curved lines and connect them at the bottom. Detail the toes with “U” shaped lines. Connect the tops of each leg with a curved line, forming the belly. 7.Draw the remaining foreleg. Use curved lines and connect them at the bottom. Then, extend a long curved line from the ear to the top of the rear leg to enclose the body. Detail the shoulder and hip with curved lines. 8.Use a curved line to enclose the remaining rear leg, partially hidden behind the first. Draw the toenails on both the front and rear legs. Extend two curved lines from the back of the body and allow them to meet at a point, forming the tail. 9.Use curved lines that meet at jagged points to enclose a tuft of hair at the tip. 10.

Lightly sketch a ground line.\n\n2. Ear & trunk guides\n   Attach two large teardrop shapes on the sides of the head for ears. From the center of the face, curve an “S” line outward for the trunk path. Add a light vertical guideline down the head and a horizontal one for eye placement.\n\n3. Block in features\n   Loosely outline the head, following the circle. Shape the trunk along your guide with a rounded tip. Mark a tiny smile line and two small ovals for cheeks.\n\n4. Define the ears\n   Trace clean, thick, rounded outlines over the ear guides. Add a second inner line to suggest the inner ear.\n\n5. Body & legs\n   Neck: a short curve from head to body. Draw two front leg stubs, then a back leg peeking from behind. Add a curved belly line.\n\n6. Details\n   Add two big oval eyes with small highlights, a tiny tail curl, and short toe splits. Optional: tiny tusks peeking beside the trunk.\n\n7. Clean-up\n   Erase construction lines. Smooth any wobbly edges so the silhouette reads clearly.\n\n8. Finish\n   Flat color: soft gray body, pink inner ears/cheeks; black eyes. Add the lightest ground shadow under the feet.\n\nQuick tips\n• Keep the head larger than the body for cuteness.\n• Place eyes low on the head and spaced widely.\n• Trunk overlaps the cheek—use that overlap to show depth.\n• If it looks stiff, slightly tilt the head and vary ear sizes a touch.\n\nIf you want any changes to the style (cuter/chibi, more realistic, side view, etc.), tell me and I’ll regenerate a new visual step sheet to match!\n",

Then, shade a large round pupil inside each eye. Between them, draw an inverted teardrop shape. This is the owlet’s beak. Draw two short lines inside it to form the nostrils. Next, draw the fluffy feathers on top of the animal’s head. Use a series of short, curved lines that meet at jagged points. 2.Draw a series of short, curved, connected lines above each eye. Use a similar series of lines - short ones that meet at gentle points - to outline the round, feathered face. Then, draw a series of lines that meet at points to outline the side of its round body. 3.Use a series of curved lines that meet at jagged points to draw the opposite side of the baby’s body. Draw the owl’s legs, using long lines for the outsides, and connect them with a series of short lines. 4.Texture the feathers of the owl’s chest using a series of short curved lines. Then, draw the bird’s foot. Draw three teardrop-shaped claws. Draw “U” shaped lines passing behind them to form the toes. 5.Draw the owl’s remaining foot. Again, draw three teardrop-shaped claws with “U” shaped lines passing behind them to form the toes. Then, begin the second owlet. Draw the eyes, using two curved lines that don’t quite meet to draw each. Shade a large round pupil inside each eye. Draw a curved triangle between the eyes, forming the beak. 6.Outline the feathery head using a series of short curved lines that meet at jagged points. Draw similar lines above the eyes. Draw a small nostril within the beak. 7.Use a series of short, curved, jagged lines to draw the wing, and another for the belly. 8.Draw the second owl’s feet. First, draw teardrop shapes for the six talons. Then, use curved lines to sketch the toes. 9.Texture each owlet’s feathers with individual curved lines and connected lines in series. Notice the bellies, the base of the neck, and the area around the beak. 10. Your owl babies outline is now complete. Color your picture. Different species of owl have different feather colors, but they range from brown to gray.",

Add a slightly smaller circle/oval on top for the head, overlapping the body a bit.\n\n2. **Guides & ear tufts**\n   Draw a faint vertical line down the head and a faint horizontal line across the middle. Add two little triangle ear-tufts at the top corners.\n\n3. **Big eye circles**\n   Add two large circles for the eye “frames,” almost touching in the middle. Keep them symmetrical.\n\n4. **Pupils & highlights**\n   Inside each eye, draw a smaller circle for the iris/pupil. Add a tiny white highlight circle so the eyes look lively.\n\n5. **Beak**\n   Between the eyes on the center line, draw a small diamond/triangle pointing down.\n\n6. **Wings**\n   On each side of the body, draw a long curved “(” and “)” shape for wings that stop above the feet area.\n\n7. **Belly patch & feather marks**\n   Draw a rounded oval on the belly. Add 2–3 rows of small “~” or “U” shapes for feathers.\n\n8. **Feet (and a branch, optional)**\n   Two stubby feet made of three rounded toes each (like a soft “W”). If you want, place them on a simple branch.\n\n9. **Clean line art**\n   Trace your favorite lines with a darker pen/marker. Erase all construction lines and overlaps.\n\n10. **Color**\n    Body: light–medium brown. Wings: darker brown. Belly: cream. Beak/feet: yellow-orange. Add a leaf on the branch for a pop of green.\n\n**Quick tips**\n\n* Keep lines light until the clean-up step.\n* If the owl looks grumpy, lift the inner top curves of the eyes a touch.\n* Big eyes and a small beak = cuter style.\n",

I'll clarify the design and layout.\n\nEach panel will show a step-by-step breakdown: Starting with basic shapes like ovals for the body and head, then adding details like ear tufts, eyes, and the beak. The following panels will show the addition of wings, feather details, feet, cleanup, and final coloring in a kid-friendly, easy-to-follow format, with numbered labels.\n\nI’ll create 10 concise steps for drawing the owl, detailing shapes, spacing, proportions, and tips for a cute chibi style—like making the head large compared to the body. I’ll keep the text friendly and casual, ensuring it’s easy for the user to follow. I’ll also mention common mistakes and optional extras, but avoid unnecessary elaboration. I’ll make sure the style is generic and copyright-free.\n\nI’ll first generate the image using the image tool, keeping things separate.

Erase guide lines as necessary. This forms the watermelon's stem. 3.Draw two sets of wavy lines extending downward from the stem. Allow one to reach the opposite side of the watermelon. For the other pair, allow the lines to meet in a sharp point. These form the first of the watermelon's characteristic stripes. 4.Draw two more stripes. Extend one set of lines down from the stem, the other up from the bottom of the melon. Allow each to end in a sharp point. 5.Draw more stripes across the watermelon, filling the empty spaces. 6.Next, you will draw a slice of cut watermelon. Draw a wide \"U\" shaped line, allowing it to overlap the completed watermelon. Then, connect the ends of the \"U\" using a straight line. 7.Give the slice a three dimensional shape by drawing a curved line from one corner of the shape to the bottom of the shape. 8.Erase the guide lines from behind the watermelon slice. 9.Detail the inside of the slice. Draw a curved line parallel to the original \"U\" shaped line. This separates the green and flavorless rind from the sweet, pink fruit. Then, draw seeds. Use a teardrop shape for each seed. Notice how the seeds are positioned in a circular pattern, with the pointed end of the teardrop toward the center. 10.Color your watermelon. The outside of the watermelon is typically striped in shades of green. The center of the melon is often pink, red, orange, or yellow.",

This is the overall slice.\n\n**Step 2 — Rind band**\nInside the arc, add a second, smaller arc that follows the first one. Leave a thin gap between them—this gap is the light-green rind.\n\n**Step 3 — Clean the edges**\nRound the two corners where the arc meets the bottom edge so the slice looks soft and juicy.\n\n**Step 4 — First seeds**\nPlace 5–7 small teardrop shapes across the pulp. Point the narrow ends toward the center.\n\n**Step 5 — Seed variety**\nAdd a few tiny dots or smaller seeds between the larger ones to make it feel natural.\n\n**Step 6 — Base colors**\nColor the pulp a bright red/pink. Fill the rind band a light green and the very outer edge a darker green. Color the seeds black.\n\n**Step 7 — Shading**\nDeepen the red slightly near the rind for a subtle gradient. Add a light, soft shadow under the slice so it sits on the page.\n\n**Step 8 — Highlights & finish**\nAdd tiny white glints on a few seeds and along the top curve. Thicken the outer outline a touch for a bold, finished look.\n\n**Optional tweaks**\n\n* Add a small “bite” notch on the top curve and adjust the seeds around it.\n* Sprinkle a couple of pale freckles on the pulp for texture.\n* Turn it into a wedge on a plate by sketching a thin oval and resting the slice on it.\n\nWant a version with fewer or more steps (e.g., a 4-step kid-friendly version)?

Then, enclose another curved shape alongside it to create a second rib. 2.Continue using long curved lines to enclose rounded ribs until the pumpkin has a round, full shape. 3.Draw the pumpkin's thick stem. Extend two curved lines from the top of the pumpkin. From each of these, draw a long curved line. The lines should be roughly parallel and \"S\" shaped. 4.Use a curved line to enclose the end of the stem. Draw another curved line across it to give the tip of the stem an oval shape. Then, texture the stem with curved lines. Use additional short lines to begin enclosing the ribs visible behind the stem. 5.Complete the pumpkin's ribs. Then, draw tendrils of vine terminating from the stem. Use long, curving, \"S\" shaped lines. 6.Draw a leaf along the pumpkin vine. First, extend a curved line from the vine. This forms the leaf's stem and vein. Then, use a series of connected, curved lines to outline the body of the leaf. 7.Continue to draw the body of the leaf on the opposite side of the vein. Then, draw secondary veins extending from the primary vein or midrib. 8.Draw the remaining veins, and begin a second leaf. Again, use a curved line for the stem and a series of curved lines to sketch the outline of the leaf. 9.Complete the leaf, erasing as necessary. Finish outlining the leaf, and draw the secondary veins. 10. Color your pumpkin. Traditionally, pumpkins are orange in color. They can also be yellow, brown, green, or white!",

Add the outer ribs\n   On the left and right, draw two long C-shaped curves that hug the oval—these are the outer pumpkin lobes.\n\n3. Fill in the middle ribs\n   Add 2–3 more curved ribs between the outer ones, all meeting near the top and bottom to suggest depth.\n\n4. Shape the top and bottom\n   Flatten the bottom with a shallow curve so it can “sit.” At the top, tuck the ribs slightly inward to form a little dip.\n\n5. Draw the stem\n   From the top dip, sketch a short, slightly curved stem (think a bent cylinder). Add a notch or two where it meets the pumpkin.\n\n6. Optional leaf & vine\n   Add a simple leaf beside the stem and a loose curly vine for character.\n\n7. Clean lines\n   Erase the original oval and any overlaps you don’t need. Thicken the outer contour slightly to make the form pop.\n\n8. Shade & color\n   Color the pumpkin a warm orange. Deepen the creases between ribs with a darker orange/brown, keep the front planes lighter, color the stem green-brown, and add a soft shadow under the pumpkin.\n\nQuick tips\n\n* Keep rib curves widest at the middle and narrower near top/bottom.\n* If it looks too round, widen the oval; if too flat, make it taller.\n* Highlights along one side instantly make it look glossy.\n",

The rule says to avoid summarizing the image, but it’s not totally clear about whether I can add instructions later. I'll find the best solution!\n\nI’m thinking through how to handle the tool’s restriction of one call per response. Here's my plan: first, I’ll send some commentary to the image generation, which will then provide the image. Then, I’ll follow it up with text steps for a clean step-by-step tutorial. I’m sticking with the pumpkin theme!\n\nFor the pumpkin drawing tutorial, I'll craft a clean and simple guide with six steps. It’ll have a basic grid layout and clear labels (Step 1, Step 2, etc.), using minimal color like black outlines and orange shading. I’ll detail each step clearly, starting with basic shapes and progressing incrementally.\n\nI’ll create a clear and simple tutorial with six numbered steps for drawing a pumpkin. It’ll be clean black line art with subtle orange shading, making it beginner-friendly. I’ll keep the focus on the pumpkin, ensuring the layout is easy to follow without too much complexity or extra text. Even the text steps will be separated.\n\nI’m going to follow the tool rules: first, I’ll send commentary with the prompt for the image, avoiding any code summary. The image itself will be generated, and then I’ll send a separate assistant message with clear and concise text drawing steps, including 8 steps and tips for shading and coloring—keeping everything beginner-friendly.",

This outlines the body, or fuselage, of the rocket. 3.Enclose the open end of the rocket using a pair of straight lines. 4.Band the nose cone with two pairs of curved parallel lines. 5.Draw portholes, or small windows, along the side of the rocket. To do so, draw several circles of different sizes. 6.Draw the rocket's fin. First, draw a straight line from the tail of the rocket to its middle. Then, draw curved lines downward from each end of the straight line. Allow the curved lines to meet at a gentle point. 7.Erase guide lines from the fin. 8.Draw the rocket's second fin. To do so, extend two curved lines from the top side of the rocket - one emerging from the middle of the ship, the other from its base. Allow the lines to meet at a gentle point. 9.Draw the flames, called exhaust, coming from the rocket's nozzle, or base. Use a series of short curved lines that meet in jagged points to draw a rounded triangular shape. Then, use another series of lines to draw a second layer. Finally, draw the third layer of the exhaust, allowing it to end at a point. 10. Color your rocket. Rockets such as the one in this drawing guide were popular illustrations during the 1950s and 1960s. Some were silver in color, while others had bright red, blue, or other colored markings.",

Keep it about 3× taller than it is wide.\n\n2. Add guide & base\n   Lightly sketch a vertical centerline and a short trapezoid at the bottom—this will become the engine/nozzle.\n\n3. Sketch the fins\n   On both sides, add curved triangles that start ~⅓ up the body and flare outward, then taper to points.\n\n4. Window/porthole\n   Near the top, draw a circle. Add a smaller inner circle for glass depth (or a ring around it).\n\n5. Panel bands\n   Add one or two horizontal bands across the lower body for seams. Keep them slightly curved to match the rocket’s form.\n\n6. Clean outline\n   Trace your best lines with a darker stroke. Erase the centerline and any construction marks.\n\n7. Fire & smoke\n   From the nozzle, draw layered flame shapes (long inner teardrop, wider outer). Add puffy smoke clouds below if you like.\n\n8. Details & color\n   Optional bolts (small dots along seams), little stars around it. Color idea: red fins/nose, gray/white body, blue window, yellow-orange flames.\n\n**Proportions & tips**\n\n* Body height ≈ 5 body-widths; fins start around the lower third.\n* Mirror the fins by measuring their base and top points from the centerline.\n* Keep line weight consistent; save thicker lines for the outer silhouette.\n\nIf you want a printable worksheet or different styles (cute/chibi, realistic, isometric), tell me the vibe and I’ll make another visual.\n",

    "text_ref": "1.Begin the fish tank outline by drawing a large rectangle. This indicates the front glass of the aquarium. On top of it, draw a long, narrow trapezoid. This forms the top of the aquarium and gives it a three-dimensional appearance. 2.Begin creating the underwater scene . Draw small, round, irregular shapes in one corner to indicate a pile of pebbles. Then, draw a wavy curved line along the bottom of the tank, forming the ground or sediment. From the back corners of the trapezoid, extend vertical straight lines. These indicate the back corners of the aquarium. Notice that they don't go all the way down; the empty spaces will soon be filled with other objects. 3.Draw the base of the aquarium. Use straight lines to draw the tops of the sides and the sides and bottom of the front. Then, draw a straight, horizontal line across the top of the base. 4.Next, draw a castle for the fish to hide in. For the turret or tower, start with the triangle-shaped roof. Then, use curved lines for the sides, midsection, and the \"U\" shaped windows. Use curved lines to draw the central section of the castle, noting the large \"U\" shaped door. Texture the castle with full and partial rectangles, simulating bricks. 5.Draw a watchtower at the top of the castle. Use small trapezoids to create the raised sections of the parapet. Connect them with curved lines, fully enclosing the castle. Then, begin drawing coral. Use curved lines to enclose the branching, tree-like shape. Finally, sketch sand along the side of the aquarium using a curved line. 6.Complete the coral, using curved lines. Texture it with small \"C\" shaped lines. Then, draw the sediment at the back and side of the fish tank using a long curved line. 7.Draw a plant or seaweed. For each leaf, extend two curved lines upward from the sediment. Allow them to cross back and forth over one another, enclosing several segments, before they finally meet at a point. Use curved lines to enclose and texture a seashell , as well as texturing the sand. 8.Introduce the fish into their new home! Use curved lines to sketch the fish's mouth, eye, pectoral fin, body, tail, and dorsal fin. Texture the fins with curved lines. Then, draw a few circular bubbles so that the fish has plenty of air to breathe. 9.Complete your fish tank outline by drawing the final fish. Follow the same steps as with the previous fish. Enclose a few more bubbles, then use wavy lines to sketch a rectangular shape at the top of the tank. This is the waterline. 10. Color your cartoon aquarium. We've shaded the aquatic residents orange to indicate that they are goldfish .",

Draw the box\n\n* Lightly sketch a rectangle for the front.\n* Add a slightly offset rectangle behind it.\n* Connect the corners to make a clear, 3-D tank.\n\n2. Define glass edges\n\n* Darken the outer edges you want visible.\n* Keep the far back edges lighter or dashed so it still reads as glass.\n\n3. Add the waterline\n\n* Draw a horizontal line a bit below the top rim, slightly wavy for realism.\n* Show the line on the side planes too so it wraps around in 3-D.\n\n4. Pour in substrate\n\n* From the bottom back corner, sketch a gentle mound toward the front.\n* Keep edges soft; it’s sand or gravel.\n\n5. Place hardscape\n\n* Add a few smooth rocks (ovals) and a piece of driftwood (bent cylinder).\n* Overlap shapes to create depth.\n\n6. Plant it\n\n* Draw simple leaf clusters: long tapered leaves for vallisneria; bushy ovals for small plants.\n* Vary heights and angles.\n\n7. Add a fish\n\n* Start with an almond/teardrop body, triangle tail, small dorsal and pelvic fins.\n* Place one fish near the middle so it’s easy to see. Add a tiny circle eye and a small mouth.\n\n8. Equipment & bubbles\n\n* Sketch a heater or filter as a slim rectangle on a back corner.\n* Add a few bubbles rising from the substrate or filter.\n\n9. Clean-up & line weight\n\n* Erase construction lines that pass through the fish and foreground objects.\n* Thicken the front rim and foreground objects slightly; keep far edges thin.\n\n10. Shine & texture (optional color)\n\n* Add a thin highlight along the front glass edge and a couple of soft vertical streaks.\n* Dot the gravel, add light shading under rocks/plants, and, if coloring, keep water pale blue and glass mostly white with subtle reflections.\n\nWant another version (cartoony, realistic, or top-view aquascape)? I can generate a different visual set too.\n",

Then, draw an oval-shaped bead overlapping the edge of the heart. 2.Draw a smaller circular bead and another oval-shaped bead. Then, begin drawing the flower-shaped bead. Draw a circle for the center of the flower and connected \"U\" shaped lines for its petals. 3.Finish the petals of the flower using \"U\" shaped lines. Then, draw another oval, circle, and oval series of beads. 4.Draw another, smaller heart, then another series of oval, circle, and oval-shaped beads. 5.On the opposite side of the large heart, draw a series of oval, circular, and oval-shaped beads. Then, draw another daisy-shaped bead. Again, use a circle for the center of the flower and connected \"U\" shaped lines for the petals. 6.Beside the flower, draw another series of oval, circle, and oval beads. Then, draw another small heart-shaped bead. 7.Draw a series of oval and circle-shaped beads extending from the heart. After the last oval-shaped bead, draw a circle within a circle. This is part of the bracelet's clasp. 8.Draw an oval within an oval passing through the circle within a circle. Erase as necessary. Then, draw two parallel curved lines entering the oval-shaped portion of the clasp. The lines will form a question mark shape. 9.Use a curved line, doubled back on itself, to form the tip of the question mark shape. At its middle, enclose a bump - the movable arm of the clasp - using a curved line. At its base, draw a circle within a circle. Use another circle within a circle to form the chain link connecting it to the rest of the bracelet. 10. Your bracelet outline is now complete. Don't forget to color it! We've left some of our beads white like pearls, while others are blue, pink, and yellow. The clasp is yellow as if made of gold.",

This is the opening of the bracelet, so keep strokes faint.\n\n2. Add band thickness\n\n   * Inside the first oval, draw a slightly smaller, parallel oval. This creates the top and inner rim.\n\n3. Define the edge and clean up\n\n   * Connect the near and far sides with short curves so the band looks three-dimensional. Erase extra construction lines.\n\n4. (Optional) Add a charm loop\n\n   * On the lower-right edge, draw a tiny ring or hook where a charm could hang.\n\n5. Switch to a beaded style (if you like)\n\n   * Lightly “walk” small circles around the oval path, spacing them evenly (mark the four compass points first, then fill the gaps).\n\n6. Refine beads\n\n   * Plump each circle, let neighboring beads overlap slightly, and outline cleanly.\n\n7. Shade for volume\n\n   * Pick a light source (top-left works well). On each bead, shade the lower-right, leave a small highlight on the upper-left. Add a soft inner rim shadow if you kept the solid band style instead of beads.\n\n8. Finish details\n\n   * Darken contact shadows between beads, add a subtle cast shadow beneath the bracelet, and draw a tiny charm (heart, star, initial) on the loop if desired.\n\nTips\n\n* Keep ellipses symmetrical by drawing through them a few times before committing.\n* If the bracelet feels too flat, thicken the band or exaggerate bead overlap.\n* For a metal bangle: skip steps 5–6, and add bright edge highlights along the outer rim.\n\nIf you want another visual showing a **chain** or **cuff** version, say the word and I’ll add it.\n",

In the lower half of the circle, draw a pie chart or Pacman shape - a circle with a missing triangular slice. What does a Pacman shape look like, exactly? Check out this Pacman pixel art . Below each eye, extend two curved lines. These are the snail's eyestalks. Then, connect the stalks with an overlapping curved line, contouring the snail's face. 2.Continue the line of the face. This line should be long and wavy, outlining the bottom of the sticky, slimy foot. 3.Draw another wavy line roughly parallel to the foot, allowing the lines to meet at a point. Draw two curved lines across the face, forming the smiling mouth and the chin. Place a short curved line at the corner of the mouth. 4.Extend the remaining side of the head with a long curved line. Double the line back on itself at the end to begin constructing the base of the shell. Connect the tip of the foot to the shell with a curved line. 5.Begin the spiral shape of the snail shell by drawing a large \"C\" shaped line. Connect it to the snail's head with a short line. 6.Continue the line of the shell to enclose the circle. Continue the line past the point of completion to begin the spiral pattern. 7.Continue the spiral-shaped line. 8.Enclose partial circles all along the spiral line. Notice that the circles grow smaller near the inside of the spiral. 9.Fill the snail shell with more circular spots. Color your cartoon snail. We've given ours a green and yellow body with a tan and brown spotted snail. 10. Throughout much of the world, garden snails are usually brown in color. But some snails - especially the ocean and marsh-dwelling snails - have vivid black-and-white patterns or unusually bright colors .",

Spiral\n   Inside the circle, draw a loose spiral that stops before the center. Keep the spacing even.\n\n3. Shell rim\n   Add a curved outline along the outside-left of the circle to give the shell a visible edge.\n\n4. Body & head\n   Under the shell, sketch a soft “bean” shape for the body, with a bump for the head in front.\n\n5. Eyestalks\n   From the head, draw two thin curved stalks. Put small circles on top for eyes.\n\n6. Face & base\n   Add a tiny smile and a closed-eye curve (or dots for pupils). Draw a gently flattened oval under the body for the foot/base.\n\n7. Details\n   Add a couple of small dots on the cheek and a few light dashes or spots on the shell for texture. You can also draw a short ground line.\n\n8. Clean & color\n   Trace final lines darker; erase extra guidelines. Color the body a warm beige or peach, the shell a green or yellow with a slightly darker spiral. Add a small shadow under the snail. Optional: a tiny mushroom or blade of grass for charm.\n\n",

    "question_type": "open",
    "text_ref": "1. The tags on your clothes tell you the best ways to clean them. Read through the tag on each garment that you’re washing to see what fabric it’s made from and how to clean it properly. Keep similar fabrics together so you can wash them at the same time. Anything that can go in your machine or that has a “hand wash only” label is safe for hand-washing. If a tag says “dry clean only,” then avoid hand-washing that garment to avoid damaging it. As a quick way to check if your garments are safe to hand-wash, place a drop of water on the fabric and blot it up with a paper towel. If the color runs or bleeds, then take it to the dry cleaners. 2. Washing similar garments in the same load prevents colors from running. Sort your laundry so all the light fabrics are separated from the dark ones. Since darker colors could potentially discolor the water, wash the lightest colored clothes first and save the darker ones for last. If you have a new item of clothing that is dyed or colored, wash it separately in a different tub or basin so the color does not get on other clothing. 3. Using a stain remover beforehand makes it easier to wash out. Apply the stain remover directly over the mark on your clothes. Gently dab the stain with your fingers or brush it lightly with a new toothbrush to work the cleaner deeper into the fabric. Let the stain remover sit for about 10–15 minutes before you wash your garment. Test the stain remover in a small inconspicuous spot on your clothes before applying it directly to the stain. 4. A mild detergent meant for delicates cleans clothes more gently. Use your bathtub, sink, or large bowl depending on how many clothes you need to wash. Stick with cool or lukewarm water when you wash your clothes to prevent colors from running. Mix about 1 1 ⁄ 2 fluid ounces (44 ml) of detergent into the water until it’s completely dissolved and forms suds. [5] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Wool and fine knits: Use cold water and wool detergent to keep the fabric soft. Silk or lace: Try a no-rinse detergent to limit how much water comes in contact with the fabric. Alternatively, use mild liquid dish soap if you’re in a pinch. 5. Gently stirring the water is less damaging to clothes than scrubbing. Drop your first load of clothes into the water so they’re submerged. Then, use your hands to gently move the clothes around to wash out the dirt between the fibers. Keep agitating the water for about 2–3 minutes, or until the clothes look clean. Sweaters: Turn sweaters inside-out before washing them to clean them better. Avoid scrubbing, twisting, or rubbing your clothes together when you hand-wash them since you could stretch and damage the fabric. 6. Soaking helps lift dirt and stains deep in the fabric. Leave your clothes submerged for at least 10 minutes so the detergent has time to work through the fabric. If your clothes are really dirty or have stubborn stains, leave them in the water for up to 30 minutes so it’s even more effective. It’s normal for the water to darken as dirt lifts out of the fabric. If the water ever looks really cloudy or dirty, empty it out and refill your container. 7. A thorough rinse removes all the detergent and leftover dirt. Either empty out your container and refill it with clean water, or hold your garments underneath a running faucet. Gently squeeze your clothes as you rinse them until you don’t see any more suds coming out. Alternatively, fill a second container with clean water and transfer your clothes over to rinse them. 8. Gently squeezing your clothes prevents them from stretching. Hold your garments above the water when you squeeze them so you don’t drip. then, lay your garment flat on a towel and slowly roll the towel up to squeeze out even more water. Avoid twisting or wringing out your clothes too forcefully since you’ll stretch or damage the fabric fibers. 9. Drying your clothes flat helps them preserve their shape. While T-shirts and pants are safe to hang dry, delicate fabrics could stretch or distort. When you’re washing sweaters, silks, bras, or lingerie, spread the garments flat so they’re shaped correctly. Keep them in a well-ventilated spot and flip your clothes over after 1–2 hours so the other side can dry. Turn a fan on in the same room as your clothes to help them dry faster. Avoid putting your clothes in the dryer unless the care tag says it’s safe. Otherwise, your clothes may get damaged or shrink.",

If it says “dry clean only,” see the notes below.\n* **Sort by color & fabric.** Wash darks separately; don’t mix heavy knits with ultra-sheer pieces.\n* **Close zippers/hooks** and turn garments inside out.\n\n## Step-by-step\n\n1. **Fill the basin** with cool/lukewarm water.\n2. **Add detergent:** about **1 tsp (5 mL) per 2 L** of water (≈½ Tbsp per gallon). Swirl to dissolve.\n3. **Pre-treat spots:** dab a drop of diluted detergent on the stain; tap gently; **test in a hidden seam** first.\n4. **Submerge the garment.** Gently press out air so it’s fully wet.\n5. **Soak** for **10 minutes** (silk: 3–5 minutes).\n6. **Agitate lightly** for **30–60 seconds**—swish and squeeze the water through the fabric. **No rubbing or wringing.**\n7. **Rinse**: drain, refill with cool water, and press water through the fabric until it runs clear (repeat as needed).\n\n   * Optional final rinse: **1 Tbsp white vinegar per gallon** to reduce residue and static (skip for garments with metal trims).\n8. **Remove excess water:** lift with two hands; press against the side of the basin. **Do not twist.**\n9. **Towel-roll:** lay flat on a clean towel, roll it up, and press along the roll to absorb water.\n10. **Dry properly:**\n\n    * **Knits/wool/cashmere:** lay flat on a dry towel or rack, **reshape** to measurements.\n    * **Lingerie/synthetics:** hang or lay on a rack; avoid clothespin dents (use padded hangers).\n    * Keep away from **direct sun or heat**; **never tumble-dry** delicates.\n\n## Fabric-specific tips\n\n* **Silk:** cool water, pH-neutral detergent, short soak; blot, then lay flat or hang to drip; press inside-out with a cool iron under a pressing cloth when nearly dry.\n* **Wool & cashmere:** cold–cool water with wool wash; avoid temperature shock; always flat-dry.\n* **Lace/tulle/beaded items:** place in a **mesh bag**, minimal agitation, flat-dry.\n* **Athletic synthetics:** avoid fabric softener (it reduces wicking); hang-dry.\n\n## Stain quick help\n\n* **Protein (blood, milk):** cold water only; dab, don’t rub.\n* **Oils/grease:** pre-treat with a small drop of detergent; let sit 5–10 min, then wash.\n* **Makeup/sunscreen:** dab with detergent solution; rinse well.\n* **Dye bleed:** if water tints, stop—rinse quickly and wash separately.\n\n## When to dry-clean instead\n\n* Structured or heavily **lined** garments, tailored suits, leather/suede, or items with heavy beading/embellishment. If unsure, test a seam first or choose professional care.\n\n## Common mistakes to avoid\n\n* Hot water, bleach, fabric softener on silk/wool, vigorous scrubbing, wringing/twisting, or drying in direct heat/sun.\n\n---\n\nIf you’d like, I can regenerate the visual as a different style (minimal icons, step photos, or dark theme) or add your specific fabrics.\n",

I'll keep it minimal and avoid unnecessary details, and take care with relevant icons, if needed. Now, I’ll move ahead with designing the image first.",

If you don't have anything to line the tray with, grease the tray with butter and add a light layer of flour over. 3. Melt the butter or margarine in a small pan over low heat. While this is melting, complete the next two steps. It should take about a minute or two for the butter to melt. It'll melt faster if you start off with it at room temperature. 4. Mix the caster sugar and eggs in a separate bowl. Pour the sugar and eggs into a medium-sized bowl and stir the ingredients together until they're fully incorporated. This should take about a minute. You can use a wooden spoon, a whisk, or even an electric mixer to stir the ingredients together. 5. Mix the flour and chocolate powder together in a separate bowl. Now, pour these ingredients into a separate bowl and stir them until they are fully incorporated. 6. Pour the melted butter into the sugar and egg mixture. Then, stir until the butter is well mixed in. This will make a nice, light yellow, creamy mixture. 7. Sift in the cocoa mixture into the egg mixture a little at a time. Just pour the ingredients into a sieve and gently shake it to let the air in while the cocoa mixture falls down into the egg mixture. You can even lightly scrape a fork along the bottom of the sieve to help sift the cocoa mixture. 8. Add the chocolate chips into the mixture. Now, you can mix in the chocolate chips into the rest of the ingredients. You can use regular chocolate chips, or cute mini chips if you prefer that. If you're feeling adventurous and want to mix things up, you can also go for the white chocolate chips. [ citation needed ] 9. Pour the mixture into the baking tray. Now that the tray is greased, it should be all ready for you to pour in the mixture. Use a flat plastic mixer or knife to even out the mixture. It doesn't have to be perfectly even, but try to distribute it around the pan as evenly as you can so that the brownies are of even height throughout. [ citation needed ] 10. Insert the tray on the middle shelf of the oven and bake for 30 minutes. After 25 minutes, keep checking on the brownies to make sure they don't burn. You can even clean up while you're waiting for your brownies to cook. If you hang around the kitchen while the brownies begin to harden, you'll be craving this sweet treat even more! 11. Remove the brownies from the oven and let them cool. Wait at least five minutes for the brownies to cool. This will also give them time to harden a bit. If you cut into them when they're still cooling, it'll be harder to cut them cleanly. 12. Cut the brownies into bite-size chunks. You can cut tiny pieces, so you can devour them in one bite each. You can also cut larger brownies, so each portion is nice and hearty. It's up to you -- if you're making them for a large event, then the smaller, the better. But if you're just cooking for yourself and a few friends or family members, why not cut them to be a little bigger? You can even top them with confectioner's sugar for an extra sweet taste.",

Prep\n   Heat oven to **350°F / 175°C**. Line pan with parchment, leaving overhang.\n\n2. Melt\n   In a saucepan over low heat, melt **butter**. Stir in **sugar** until glossy and warm (about 1–2 min). Remove from heat; cool 2–3 min until just warm.\n\n3. Whisk wet\n   Whisk in **eggs** one at a time until smooth and shiny, then whisk in **vanilla**.\n\n4. Combine dry\n   In a bowl, whisk **flour, cocoa, salt** (and baking powder if using).\n\n5. Make batter\n   Stir dry ingredients into the warm butter-egg mixture just until no dry spots remain. Fold in **chocolate chips/nuts** if using. Batter will be thick.\n\n6. Pan\n   Scrape batter into the lined pan and smooth the top.\n\n7. Bake\n   Bake **20–25 min** (fudgy) until the edges are set and a toothpick in the center comes out with a few moist crumbs (not wet batter).\n\n8. Cool & slice\n   Cool in the pan on a rack **at least 20–30 min**. Lift out with parchment and slice into squares.\n\n## Tips\n\n* For extra fudgy: bake toward **20–22 min**, skip baking powder.\n* For cakier: bake to **25–28 min** and include baking powder.\n* Shiny top trick: make sure the sugar fully dissolves into the warm butter and whisk the eggs well.\n* Storage: airtight at room temp **3–4 days**, or freeze up to **2 months** (wrap tightly).\n\nWant a gluten-free or vegan variant?

    "prompt": "How to bake cookies from scratch? Show each step both visually and textually.",
    "source": "https://www.wikihow.com/Bake-Cookies",
    "task_type": "life_skill_generation",
    "question_type": "open",
    "text_ref": "1. Keep everything cold. If you are using butter in your cookies (and even, to a certain degree, if you aren't) you will want to keep your ingredients refrigerator-cold. This will make your cookies much more firm and keep them from spreading out in the oven. This means that you'll have to warm up the butter enough to work with it by placing it on the counter, rather than in the microwave. Absolutely never melt it in order to mix it into the dough. A great practice is to cool your dough in the fridge for an hour before rolling it out. 2. Always cream butter and sugar. If your recipe calls for butter and doesn't specifically prohibit this practice, you should always \"cream\" the butter and the sugar first. This is a process by which you mix the two until a sort of paste is formed. 3. Try to use salted butter. Sweet cream butter tends to make cookies taste too sweet. The salt will balance out the sweetness of the cookie just enough to make it taste much better over all. You won't be able to properly taste the salt, but believe us, you'll notice the difference. 4. Change the recipe to alter the final product. If you find a recipe that you love the taste of but want a different texture, it is totally possible to alter the recipe just a bit in order to get exactly what you want! Experiment, or try these tricks: Use cake flour instead of regular flour, shortening instead of butter (or for part of the butter), or about 2 teaspoons of cornstarch along with 4 teaspoons less flour in order to get fluffy, cakey, and softer cookies. Use 2 tablespoons of milk, an extra tablespoon or two of butter, or switch your white sugar for brown to get a crispy cookie. Use melted butter to mix dough and then chill it before baking (undercook a minute or two) to get a chewy cookie. You can also use only yolks, instead of whites. Using a rubber spatula often helps speed up the mixing process if you are not using a machine. 5. Weigh your ingredients. If you find that you still struggle with getting your recipe to turn out right, bake like the pros (and Europeans!) do and weigh your ingredients. Get a good electronic kitchen scale and do your recipe based on weight. This will help ensure the perfect cookie. 6. Use an ice cream scoop to make cookies even. If you want to make sure that every cookie in a batch turns out looking the same, use an ice cream scoop to get perfectly equal balls of dough. 7. Use parchment paper. Skip the Silpat in favor of parchment paper. Silpat can make it difficult for cookies to cook evenly and it also keeps the bottoms from developing that perfect crispness. Parchment paper turns out a much better cookie. 8. Bake on the bottom of your cookie sheet. If you notice that the cookies at the edge of your sheet are prone to getting over cooked, use an Round or oval pan. If you don't have one, improvise and flip the pan over to use the bottom! 9. Know your oven. Every oven is different and it is important for you to know how yours behaves. If you know what to expect, then you can find ways to work around the expected problems. For example, if you notice that cookies on one corner or side bake faster than in another, make sure you turn the pan part-way through the baking process. 10. Start with a cold pan. Put your baking sheet in the fridge to cool before you put each set of cookies on. If you want to save time, you can scoop the dough onto parchment paper and store them in the fridge until they are ready to go out on a cooled pan. This means cooling the pan between each set of 12 too! 11. Don't overbake your cookies. If anything it's better to under-bake them. For the first batch carefully watch them and time for when they get the first hint of brown at the edges. Edge browning usually means you've gone too far, though these cookies are still perfectly good (especially if you like yours crispy!). Once you know how long it takes to reach that point, pull them out maybe 30 seconds before they brown for perfectly soft cookies. If you are using white chocolate chips in your cookies, be careful, as they can burn particularly easily. 12. Let cookies sit on the pan. Let your cookies sit on the pan for a few minutes before taking them off. This will let them firm up on the bottom, making them much easier to remove.",

They’ll finish setting as they cool.\n\n## Doneness Cues\n\n* Edges: lightly golden;\n* Centers: soft, a touch pale;\n* Surface: faint cracks with glossy melted chocolate.\n\n## Pro Tips\n\n* **Temperature matters:** butter should be soft but cool (no oily sheen).\n* **Thickness control:** Chill longer for thicker cookies; bake right away for thinner, chewier edges.\n* **Wrinkly tops:** Halfway through baking, **rap** the pan once on the rack.\n\n## Variations\n\n* **Browned-Butter:** Brown 170 g butter; cool till just fluid, then proceed. Adds a nutty note (cookies spread a bit more).\n* **Nutty Crunch:** Add ½ cup toasted chopped pecans or walnuts.\n* **Salted:** Finish with a **pinch of flaky salt** after baking.\n* **Oat-Choc Chip:** Swap 50 g (½ cup) of flour for quick oats.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n* **Too flat:** Butter too warm; dough under-chilled; oven too cool.\n* **Too cakey/dry:** Over-measured flour; overbaked; overmixed.\n* **Greasy edges:** Butter too warm; try chilling 30–60 min.\n\n## Storage & Make-Ahead\n\n* **Baked:** Airtight at room temp **3–4 days**.\n* **Dough balls:** Freeze on a tray, then bag; bake from frozen **12–14 min** at 350°F.\n\n——\n\nI’ll now generate a separate step-by-step visual guide that matches this recipe. 😊\n\n\nIf you’d like the visual saved as a printable PDF or with different colors/sizes, tell me your preference and I’ll regenerate it to match.",

    "task_type": "life_skill_generation",
    "question_type": "open",
    "text_ref": "1. Fill a large pot about 2/3 full of water. Since the pasta needs lots of room to move around as it cooks, use a big pot. For example, if you'll be cooking a 1 pound (450 g) box of pasta, get out a pot that's at least 4 US quarts (3.8 L) in size. Then, pour in enough water to come 2/3 up the side of the pot. If you use a pot that's too small, your pasta is more likely to clump together as it cooks. 2. Cover the pot and bring the water to a boil. Set the pot of water on the stove and put a lid on it. Turn the burner to high and let the water come to a boil. You'll know the water is boiling when you see steam escaping from under the lid. Covering the pot with a lid will make the water boil faster. 3. Add salt and 1 pound (450 g) of pasta to the boiling water. Once the water boils vigorously, remove the lid and add 1 tablespoon (17 g) of salt and 1 pound (450 g) of pasta. If you're cooking long noodles, such as spaghetti, that don't fit in the pot, wait about 30 seconds and then push them into the water using a spoon or pasta fork. The salt will season the noodles as they cook, which will give you flavorful pasta. If you're unsure how many servings of pasta to cook, check the side of the box for recommended serving sizes. 4. Set a timer for 3 to 8 minutes. Stir the noodles with a pasta fork to break the noodles up and leave the lid off the pot. Then, check the pasta package for a recommended cooking time and set a timer for the minimum time that's suggested. For example, if the box says to cook the noodles for 7 to 9 minutes, set a timer for 7 minutes. Thin pasta, such as angel hair, will cook faster than thick or long noodles, such as fettuccine or penne, which take closer to 8 or 9 minutes. 5. Stir the noodles occasionally as they boil. The water should continue to bubble as the pasta cooks. Stir it every few minutes to prevent the noodles from sticking together. If the water looks like it might boil over the sides of the pot, turn the burner down to medium-high. 6. Bite into a noodle to see if it's cooked enough for you. Carefully scoop a noodle out of the water when the timer beeps and set it aside to cool a little. Bite into the noodle to tell if it's still hard in the center or if it's as soft as you like. Most people prefer to cook pasta until it's al dente, which means it's still a little firm in the center. If the pasta is still too hard for your liking, boil it for another minute before checking it again.",

This seasons the pasta itself.\n\n3. Rolling boil first\n\n* Wait for a **vigorous, rolling boil (100°C / 212°F)** before adding pasta. Lids help you get there; remove the lid once boiling.\n\n4. Add pasta & stir early\n\n* Drop pasta in and **stir for the first 1–2 minutes** to prevent sticking, then stir occasionally.\n\n5. Cook to al dente (taste, don’t guess)\n\n* Start tasting **2 minutes before** the package’s low end.\n* Al dente = cooked through with a pleasant bite and no chalky center.\n\n6. Save some pasta water\n\n* **Reserve ½–1 cup** starchy water before draining. It helps sauces cling and lets you adjust thickness.\n\n7. Drain, don’t rinse\n\n* **Do not rinse** (you’ll wash off starch). Only rinse if making a **cold pasta salad**.\n\n8. Marry pasta with sauce\n\n* Finish pasta **in a pan with the sauce** for 1–2 minutes, loosening with splashes of reserved water and finishing with a knob of butter or olive oil if desired. Season to taste.\n\n9. Rest & serve hot\n\n* Let it sit **30–60 seconds** off heat to settle the sauce; plate immediately.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Timing Reference (start tasting early!)\n\n* **Fresh pasta (eggs)**: 2–4 min\n* **Dry thin long (spaghetti, linguine)**: 8–10 min\n* **Dry short (penne, rigatoni, fusilli)**: 9–12 min\n* **Thick/shape with ridges or whole wheat**: 11–13+ min\n* **Gluten-free**: often **less forgiving**—taste frequently in the last few minutes.\n\n---\n\n## Common Mistakes & Fixes\n\n* **Pot too small** → water cools off and pasta sticks. Use a larger pot.\n* **Under-salting** → flat flavor. Salt the water properly.\n* **Adding pasta before a full boil** → gummy texture. Wait for the rolling boil.\n* **Not stirring early** → clumps. Stir in the first 1–2 minutes.\n* **Overcooking** → mush. Taste early and often.\n* **Rinsing after draining** → sauce won’t cling. Don’t rinse unless for cold dishes.\n\n---\n\n## Pro Tips\n\n* For silky sauces, emulsify: **toss pasta + sauce + reserved water** over medium heat until glossy.\n* Cooking for later? **Undercook by ~1 minute**, then finish in sauce when reheating.\n* High altitude: water boils at a lower temp—**add a minute or two** and rely on tasting.\n\nIf you want, I can tailor the infographic for a specific pasta shape or serving size.\n",

The tool suggests that once the image is generated, I can't summarize it—just respond with an empty message. But I still need to provide the image and text together. I'll figure out the sequence.\\n\\nHandling text and image together\\nHmm, I'm running into a slight conflict here. The system asks for an empty message immediately after generating the image. But I also need to send the text explanation. Perhaps I should send the text before generating the image so I can output an empty message afterward, as the tool requires.\\n\\nReworking the process\\nI'm thinking about how to handle the image generation and text. The guidelines say I can't summarize the image once it's created, but I need to send both text and the image. A potential solution might be to send the image and then text as two separate messages, but I’m not sure if that's allowed. I'll need to check how that works in this interface.",

It also helps to do this process in the bathroom, as you'll need a ready supply of hot water and somewhere to wash away the dead skin flakes once they've been scrubbed off. Use a skin-friendly, perfume-free detergent for bath and allow at least 15 minutes to soften (macerating) the skin surface. It is good when the skin surface looks a bit \"deformed\". Remove \"dead skin\" by rubbing it away with your hands. It will work well, especially at your feet, toes and heels. 2. Get a textured sponge to wash your skin. Tending to your skin with it will help rub away excess skin flakes, leaving your skin softer and cleaner than before. It is recommended you have a sponge ready for use once you have finished up your shower. It should feel slightly rough on your skin, but if it's abrasive to the point of pain, exfoliating wash cloths are a suitable, gentler alternative. Exfoliating can also be done with a rough washcloth. A natural bristle brush makes for a good alternative, particularly while scrubbing the backs of arms or legs. If you're the do-it-yourself type, you might look into making your own loofah from home. 3. Scrub your body gently with your sponge starting from the ankles upward. Scrub the sponge over your skin in small, circular motions. Make sure to apply some pressure to feel the sponge's rough texture on your skin; that way, it will rub the surface-layer dead skin away. Starting at the ankles is recommended because it helps to encourage positive blood circulation during the exfoliation process. If you're exfoliating your entire body, make sure to give extra attention to your heels, elbows, and knees. These are generally considered to be the driest parts of one's skin, and should be given greater attention accordingly. 4. Add wet sand or salt to your full body exfoliation. If you've ever walked along the beach barefoot, you may have noticed your foot callouses soften. Sand granules are a naturally occurring exfoliant, and their grainy texture is well-suited to scraping away your excess skin flakes. Salt scrubs do the same thing. You can find sand and salt exfoliating products at any store that sells beauty and skincare products. Be forewarned: Using sand in the bath can cause a bigger mess than more common exfoliants. Although it is recommended to try it out at least once, it may not be the best course of action if you don't have the added time in your routine available to do a bit of cleaning up afterwards. Getting sand down a drain could completely ruin the plumbing pipes if done often. If using sand, it should be cleaned, even bleached, because getting it from outdoors could introduce bacteria and using that to exfoliate would do more harm than good. Choose sand with small granules, not big, because the smaller granules are more gentle on the skin. Focus on the tougher skin of the arms and legs because sand can be more intense than exfoliating scrubs. 5. Rinse with hot water. Closing up shop with a body rinse is a relaxing and effective way to finish your exfoliation. Although it's recommended you repeat this process at least three times a week, you should notice an immediate softness with your skin. Applying a moisturizer or shea butter following your rinse, even following an otherwise purely 'mechanical' cleanse, will help your skin better retain moisture.",

Skip if skin is inflamed.\n* **Chemical (acids/actives):**\n\n  * **AHAs** (lactic, glycolic): dry/dull or uneven texture.\n  * **BHA** (salicylic): body breakouts, clogged pores, ingrowns.\n  * **PHA** (gluconolactone, lactobionic): very sensitive skin.\n  * **Urea** (10–20%): rough bumps/keratosis pilaris (KP).\n\n## 2) Step-by-step routine (shower days)\n\n1. **Soak** in warm (not hot) water for 5–10 min.\n2. **Cleanse** with a gentle, non-stripping body wash.\n3. **Exfoliate**\n\n   * *Physical:* massage with light pressure in small circles for 30–60 sec per area; avoid chest/neck if sensitive.\n   * *Chemical:* apply a thin layer per label. Rinse-off: 1–3 min. Leave-on lotions: use a light, even coat—don’t scrub.\n4. **Rinse & pat dry** (don’t rub).\n5. **Moisturize within 3 minutes.** Look for glycerin, hyaluronic acid, ceramides; for very dry skin, seal with a light oil/occlusive.\n6. **Daytime SPF 30+** on exposed areas (AHAs/BHAs increase sun sensitivity).\n\n## 3) How often?\n\n* **Sensitive:** 1×/week (soft cloth or PHA).\n* **Normal/combination:** 1–2×/week.\n* **Dry/KP-prone:** 2–3×/week (lactic acid or urea, avoid gritty scrubs).\n* **Oily/acne-prone:** 2–3×/week BHA on problem zones (back, chest).\n\n> Signs you’re overdoing it: stinging that lasts, tightness, shiny but fragile skin, more redness or breakouts. Cut back to once weekly.\n\n## 4) Do’s & don’ts\n\n**Do**\n\n* Use gentle pressure; let products do the work.\n* Rinse mitts/cloths after each use; wash weekly; replace loofahs monthly.\n* Exfoliate **before** shaving (same session is OK for gentle physical or mild rinse-off acids).\n* Moisturize every time.\n\n**Don’t**\n\n* Exfoliate on sunburn, open cuts, or active eczema/psoriasis flares.\n* Mix strong actives on the same day (e.g., retinoids + strong acids).\n* Exfoliate right after waxing/laser; wait **48–72 hours**.\n* Use very hot water.\n\n## 5) Targeted tips\n\n* **Ingrown hairs/razor bumps:** Use BHA 0.5–2% the day **before** shaving and again 24–48 h after; shave with slip (gel/cream) in hair-growth direction.\n* **Keratosis pilaris:** Daily urea 10–20% or lactic acid 5–12% lotion; brief gentle physical buffing 2–3×/week; be patient (4–6 weeks).\n* **Feet/elbows/knees:** Can tolerate slightly stronger scrubs—keep separate tools for feet.\n\n## 6) Simple weekly template\n\n* **Mon:** BHA on back/chest after shower → moisturize.\n* **Wed:** Gentle washcloth buff head-to-toe → moisturize.\n* **Fri:** Lactic-acid or urea body lotion (leave-on) at night.\n* **Sun (optional):** Spot-treat rough patches only.\n\n*Friendly reminder:* If you’re pregnant/nursing or on prescription topicals, check product safety first. Stop and consult a professional if you develop a rash, severe burning, or infection.\n",

    "text_ref": "1. Wash your hands before cleaning your glasses. Wash up for 20 seconds with lotion-free soap and warm water. You’ll need to make sure your hands are free of dirt, grease, and grime before cleaning your glasses. 2. Rinse your glasses with warm water. Run a gentle stream of tap water over your glasses. Rotate them to wet both sides of each lens, the frame, and earpieces. Hot water is bad for lenses, protective coatings, and the frame, so be sure to use warm water. 3. Use your fingertips to carefully lather them with dish soap. Add a small drop of lotion-free dish soap to each lens. Make gentle circular motions with your fingertips to lather the soap over both sides of your lenses, around the frame, and down each earpiece. 4. Clean the nose pads with a cotton swab or soft toothbrush. Use gentle pressure as you scrub the nose pads and the crevices between them and the frame. If you’re using a toothbrush, make sure it’s soft-bristled. Avoid grazing the lenses with the toothbrush, even if it’s soft-bristled. If there’s buildup between the lenses and the frame, use a cotton swab to loosen it. 5. Wash away soap residue. Hold the glasses under running water again to rinse away soap suds. Make sure you’ve washed away all traces of soap, as any remaining residue will cause smudges. 6. Shake off excess water and make sure your lenses are clean. Turn off the water, then give your glasses a careful shake. Check the lenses to make sure they’re clear, and wash them again if you see any smudges. 7. Dry your glasses with a microfiber cloth. Fold a clean microfiber cloth over both sides of a lens. Make soft circular motions with your fingertips to dry it, then repeat on the other lens. Wipe the nose pads, then use the cloth to dry and polish the frame and earpieces. [6] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source 8. Spray your glasses liberally with eyeglass cleaner. Spray cleaners for eyewear are available at pharmacies and eyewear retailers. If you can’t get to a sink and dish soap, spray your glasses with lots of cleaner to flush away dirt and debris. Some eyewear manufacturers and optometrists also offer free samples of spray cleaner. If you have anti-reflective (AR) glasses, make sure the cleaner you use is labelled safe for the AR coating. 9. Wipe away the cleaner with a microfiber cloth. After spraying your glasses, carefully wipe off excess cleaner. Fold the cloth over both sides of each lens, and make gentle circular motions with your fingertips to absorb the cleaner. Then use the cloth to dry the frame and earpieces. 10. Touch up your lenses with disposable eyeglass wet wipes. You can also clean your glasses with wet wipes when you’re on the go. Gently blow on them to remove dust and dirt, then gently rub them with a wet wipe using soft, circular motions. After cleaning them, dry them with a microfiber cloth. Only use wet wipes labelled for cleaning eyewear. If you have AR glasses, make sure your wipes are labelled safe for the AR coating. 11. Clean your glasses every morning and as needed. Make cleaning your glasses part of your morning routine. Check them regularly throughout the day, and touch them up as needed. Keeping your glasses clean and smudge-free will help prevent scratches. 12. Store your glasses in a hard case when you’re not wearing them. Don’t just throw your glasses in your purse or bag, and avoid placing the lenses on hard surfaces. When they’re not in use, keep them in a hard-shell case. The case should fit your glasses; if it’s too big, they might roll around and get damaged. [11] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source 13. Wash your microfiber cloths frequently. Microfiber cloths collect grease and dirt, so you should wash yours after 2 or 3 uses. Some cloths are machine washable, so check the care instructions and launder them as directed. [12] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source If your cloth isn’t machine washable, or if you’re not sure, hand wash it with dish soap, wring it out, then let it air dry. 14. Don’t wipe your glasses with your shirt, tissue, or a paper towel. Shirts, tissues, and paper towels contain fine debris that could scratch your glasses. Additionally, never wipe your glasses when they’re dry, or you’ll risk damaging them. Exhaling on your glasses and wiping them with your shirt might be convenient, but that’s a quick way to scratch up your lenses. Need help keeping your glasses clean?

It should show the steps of washing hands, rinsing gently, applying mild soap, cleaning the lenses and frames with care, rinsing thoroughly, drying, and using lens cleaner. I'll also advise against using hot water or harsh cleaners like ammonia, and suggest optional buffing or deep cleaning weekly.\n\nI want to provide a simple, clear guide on how to clean eyeglasses without causing damage. It should be concise, with a quick recipe for a homemade cleaner using mild dish soap or diluted alcohol, but I'll caution against alcohol-based cleaners if unsure. I’ll also caution about polycarbonate and AR coatings. Then, I’ll craft a minimalist infographic with high-contrast icons and a clean, clear design.\n\nI’m planning to create a clear, easy-to-follow visual guide for cleaning eyeglasses with numbered steps and illustrations: washing hands, rinsing the eyewear, applying dish soap, and thorough drying/polishing. I'll also include a do/don’t sidebar with icons. A single image will work, and I’ll be clear with text instructions afterward.\n\nI'm creating a concise and friendly step-by-step guide for cleaning eyeglasses. I'll list 8 clear steps: washing hands, rinsing the frames with lukewarm water, using a small drop of soap, gentle cleaning, rinsing to prevent redeposit, drying with microfiber, and finishing with proper lens cleaner if needed.

    "text_ref": "1. Find a safe area where traffic won’t be a risk. If you are near a road, park as far from traffic as possible and turn on your emergency hazard lights. Don’t park on an incline to keep your vehicle from rolling away, and stay off of soft soil or grass. If you have to drive slowly for a block or two to get to a safe, flat area, then so be it.Examples of safe areas are as follows: The shoulder of the highway, a public parking lot, or a large space with no pedestrian activity. Apply the parking brake once you’re parked to ensure the vehicle doesn’t move. For added peace of mind, place heavy rocks or blocks around each tire you aren’t changing to keep the vehicle from rolling. 2. The spare will likely be underneath a cover in the trunk. Every make and model will be a little bit different, but your spare should be under the cloth or plastic cover at the bottom of your trunk. Retrieve the wheel from the trunk. Also, remove the jack and the tire iron you need to remove the lug nuts. The tools for completing the change - including the jack, and lug wrench - will be located near the spare tire. On most vehicles, the tire iron is part of the jack. You’ll use it to turn the bolt on the end of the jack to raise or lower it, and also to remove the lug nuts on the tire. If you drive a Jeep or a large SUV, the spare tire may be on the outside or underneath the vehicle. If you don’t have a spare, your vehicle may have a sealant kit to temporarily patch your flat tire . If you don’t have that either, call a tow truck. 3. Remove the hubcap and loosen the nuts part-way. Start with the lowest bolt and avoid causing damage to the undamaged bolts/lug nuts. Pry the hubcap off using the flat end of your tire iron or a flathead screwdriver. Do not remove the lug nuts entirely. Just use the end of the tire iron to loosen the nuts by turning them counterclockwise so that there’s no longer any resistance. You should be able to spin the nuts by hand, but they shouldn’t be so loose that they spin freely. By keeping the wheel on the ground when you first loosen the nuts, you'll make sure that you're turning the nuts instead of the wheel. Your tire iron may have different sizes of openings on each end. The correct end for the nut will slip easily onto it, but it won’t be so loose that it rattles. If your vehicle doesn’t have a hub cap, don’t worry about that part. If it does, your hub cap may have a center cap that needs to be unscrewed first. On some newer vehicles you need a special “key” to unlock one of the lug nuts as a theft prevention strategy. Look in your glove box and trunk for a special tool that’ll remove that unique lug nut. These lug nuts will have a unique groove inside of them. Use the key to remove the locking lug nut. Keep all bolts as you will be using them to connect your spare tire to your car. 4. Place the divot in the jack directly under the metal rim of the frame. Get on the ground and use the flashlight on your phone to take a closer look. Touch the area directly behind the metal body of your exterior to feel and look for a thin, metal length. This is your frame. Set the jack underneath the frame right next to the tire you’re replacing. Many cars have molded plastic along the bottom. If you don't place the jack in the right spot, it will crack the plastic when you start lifting. If you're not sure about the right place to put the jack, read your owner's manual. There may be a small notch or mark just behind the front wheel wells, or in front of the rear wheel wells where the jack is intended to be placed. 5. Use the jack to raise your tire 4–6 inches (10–15 cm) off of the ground. Turn the handle of the jack clockwise to begin raising the platform up. Once the platform on the jack makes contact with the vehicle, take a look at the point where the jack meets the frame to confirm it’s on your frame. If it isn’t, loosen the jack and reposition it. If it is, continue to lift your vehicle off the ground . The vast majority of jacks are scissor jacks. You use the tire iron or a rod to twist the nut on the side and hoist the vehicle. You might have a pump-assisted jack, though. With a pump jack, you repeatedly move the handle up and down to raise the vehicle hydraulically. This can be kind of freaky the first time you do it. You might think your jack is going to snap or your car is going to tilt over. Don’t worry! Your jack and vehicle are designed to handle this. It can take a few minutes and a lot of elbow grease to get that vehicle up, so feel free to take breaks if you need to. It’s worth double-checking to make sure the jack is on the frame. You really don’t want to damage your vehicle with the jack. Make sure the vehicle is secure in the air by pressing down on the side of the vehicle that is jacked up in the air. Next, you need to add some wheel chalks to the opposite side wheels of the vehicle. If you have the car jacked from the front left side of the vehicle, then you would want to place two wheel-chocks under the rear tires to prevent the vehicle from rolling. 6. Pop the nuts off by hand and pull the tire off. You already loosened the nuts, so removing them should be fairly easy. Use the tire iron and brace the tire with your non-dominant hand if you need to. With all of the lug nuts removed, slide your busted wheel off of the axle and set it aside. Flip your hubcap upside down to turn it into a small bowl and set your lug nuts inside so that you don’t lose them. Use the proper body mechanics when dismounting a tire. Mounting and dismounting a tire is very tiresome and heavy on your back so you always want to make sure you squat using your legs with your back straight. Never place your legs under the vehicle while it's lifted up because that's a safety hazard. If you can, grab a small mechanics chair as this will help secure your back. 7. The side of the spare with the valve stem on it faces out. Line the lug nut bolts up with the openings on the spare and slide the spare on to the axle - holding the tires at the positions of 4 and 8, lifting the tire slightly and pulling the tire out. The valve stem is the little rubber pipe that sticks out where you add air to the tire. If it’s pointed inward towards the body of the vehicle, the tire is backwards. Fun fact, the spare tire is also known as a “donut.” Take one of the bolts you removed from the old tire, take your spare tire, and align the sockets on the tire rim with the sockets on the tire mount, then place the tire on the mount. Insert the bolt into the topmost socket and rotate the bolt into its socket enough to ensure the tire will not fall off the mount, but not too tightly as to fully insert the bolt into the socket. Grab the tire using proper body mechanics (this is important for your physical health) by getting down on one knee and rolling the tire onto your foot. Carefully lift with your arms and foot to align the tire with the hub. Align the tire with the wheel hub. Press the tire and wheel against the hub so that it sits completely flushed and symmetrical with the hub bearing (this is important for tightening reasons). Keep your foot pressed onto the tire to secure it. Begin screwing the lug nuts back on. First, you want to make sure that you're hub cap is securely placed back on. Start with one lug nut and thread it all the way down on the wheel stud to help hold the tire on the hub. 8. Don’t tighten the nuts using the tire iron just yet. Gently slide each over the bolt and tighten it by hand to partially lock them in place. You will tighten the lug nuts again once the car is down and there is no risk of it falling. Just to clarify, use the same lug nuts that were previously on your wheel. You don’t need special lug nuts for the spare. 9. With the wheel on the axle, lower the jack and remove it. Turn the handle or bolt on the jack counterclockwise to begin lowering the vehicle. Continue lowering the vehicle until the tire is comfortably back on the ground. Then, carefully remove the jack from underneath and set it back in your trunk. Go to source Keep your entire body out from underneath the vehicle. If the jack slips your vehicle gets closer to the ground, you don’t want your body underneath it. 10. Completely tighten the nuts until they won’t turn any further. Using the tire iron, tighten each nuts 3-4 times and then move on to the lug nut on the opposite side. Work in a star pattern to ensure the nuts are secured in an even pattern. Continue tightening the nuts in a cycle until all of the lug nuts are completely secure. Go to source After you’ve tightened each nut, try to tighten each nut one more time to ensure they’re as tight as they can possibly get. Put your busted tire in the trunk alongside the jack and tire iron.",

If you can’t get fully out of traffic or it’s a blind curve, bridge, or narrow shoulder, **call roadside assistance** instead.\n* Turn on **hazard lights**. Put on a **reflective vest** if you have one.\n* Set the **parking brake** (and put the car in Park; manual: 1st gear or Reverse).\n* Place **wheel chocks**/big stones **on both sides** of a tire opposite the flat (e.g., if front-left is flat, chock the right-rear).\n* Get people and pets away from the traffic side. Never crawl under the vehicle.\n\n## Tools you’ll need\n\n* Spare tire (compact “donut” or full-size)\n* Jack and **owner’s-manual jack point locations**\n* Lug wrench (and locking-lug key if you have one)\n* Wheel chocks, gloves, flashlight, and warning triangle/cones (if available)\n\n## Step-by-step\n\n1. **Prep the area**\n   Place a warning triangle 100–200 ft (30–60 m) behind the car if safe to do so.\n\n2. **Expose the lugs**\n   Remove the hubcap/wheel cover if present.\n\n3. **Break the lug nuts loose**\n   With the wheel **still on the ground**, use the lug wrench to loosen each nut about ½–1 turn. Push down with your foot if needed; don’t fully remove them yet.\n\n4. **Position the jack at the correct jack point**\n   Check your manual for the reinforced spot near the flat tire. Never jack on plastic trim or thin metal.\n\n5. **Lift the vehicle**\n   Raise until the flat tire just clears the ground by an inch or two (2–5 cm). Keep your body and limbs out from under the car.\n\n6. **Remove the flat wheel**\n   Spin off the loosened lug nuts and set them in a safe spot (a hubcap works). Pull the wheel straight off the hub.\n\n7. **Mount the spare**\n   Line up the holes with the studs; slide the wheel fully onto the hub. Thread the lug nuts **by hand** until snug.\n\n8. **Initial tighten in a star pattern**\n   Using the wrench, snug the nuts in a **star/ criss-cross** sequence—do not fully torque yet.\n\n9. **Lower the vehicle and final tighten**\n   Lower the car until the tire just contacts the ground and the jack is free. Now fully tighten the nuts in the **same star pattern** until firmly secure. (Later, torque to your vehicle’s spec.)\n\n10. **Stow and check**\n    Put the flat and tools away, remove chocks/triangle, and check the spare’s pressure. For compact spares, **observe the sidewall limits** (often around 50 mph / 80 km/h and short distances). Drive to a tire shop for repair or replacement **as soon as possible**.\n\n## Extra tips\n\n* If a nut won’t budge, apply steady pressure rather than jerky motions; a short pipe over the wrench handle can help (carefully).\n* If the jack sinks on soft ground, place a solid board under it.\n* After 5–10 miles (8–16 km), **re-check lug nut tightness**.\n* If you have **TPMS**, the warning light may stay on until the repaired tire is back on.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can also turn these steps into a printable one-page checklist or add car-specific jack points based on your make/model.\n",

    "question_type": "open",
    "text_ref": "1. Remove all of the clothes from your closet. Take all of your clothes off their hangers and out of any bins or drawers in your closet. Fold them in piles on the floor or on your bed. This includes your shoes as well. It may also include other accessories such as belts, scarves, purses, or ties. 2. Decide which clothes you will keep. You may have the urge to keep everything, or toss everything. But go through systematically and piece by piece to really scrutinize your clothing. What you want in your closet are clothes that you wear on a regular basis, that fit you and are functional, and fit in the space available. Does the item fit? Clothing in the closet should fit you properly, neither too loose nor too tight. It typically means it is comfortable, not pinching, clothing can button easily, and no red marks left on the skin. It may also mean letting go of items no longer in fashion, such as skin tight skirts you really should not wear to your professional job. It is usually best to let go of \"inspirational items\" such as the jeans you hope to someday fit back into; trends being what they are the item may well be out of fashion when you do lose the weight. One pair of \"fat pants\" may be OK to remind you of your weight loss accomplishment. If your weight is fluctuating up or down (such as in growing young adults, pregnant women, or dieters) this may be tricky. Still, get rid or store items that clearly do not fit you. Do I wear this? Have you worn the item in the last year? How often do you wear it: once a week or only once this year? If you have not worn the item in a long time, that may well indicate it is time to let go. Special use items may be OK to keep even if used only periodically. You might have a Christmas sweater, or interview outfit, or formal dress that isn't used often but still worth having available. Do I like this? If you really don't like an item, do not keep it. In general, do not hang onto items out of guilt--such as that shirt your father bought you but you just do not like. Do I have multiples of this? Work or school uniforms are one thing. But if you have seven black almost identical t-shirts, that might be a sign to let go of a few. Make a \"Keep\" pile for the clothes that you will keep and wear on a regular basis. 3. Decide which clothes you will store. You should store the clothes that you won't be wearing for a while because they aren't seasonally appropriate. If it's the middle of summer, you can store your winter sweaters and scarves, and if it's the dead of winter, you can store your tank tops and summer dresses. You can also store clothes that may have sentimental value for you, such as a shirt your grandmother knitted for you, or an old t-shirt from your high school tennis team that no longer fits. Try to keep the sentimental value clothes to a minimum, though. Clothes are meant to be worn, after all. Consider displaying beloved clothing instead of keeping them in your closet. Consider framing your prized concert T-shirt, or creating a shadow box of your Boy Scout uniform and awards, or make a T-shirt quilt of your old marathon shirts. When you're done sorting through the clothes you will store, put them in a plastic bin or a clear bag marked keep. You can either store them in the back of your closet, under your bed, or in a storage unit or a different part of your home if you have the room. 4. Decide which clothes you will donate or throw out. This is the hardest step, and the most important. If you want to have a truly organized closet, then your goal should be to get rid of as many items of clothing as possible. This doesn't mean you should throw out your favorite things - however, it does mean that you should take a long hard look to ask yourself which clothes you will actually ever wear again. If you haven't worn something in over a year and it has no sentimental value, it's time to donate it. If you have an item that is so worn, covered in moth holes, or faded that you and anyone else will never wear it again, then it's time to throw it out. If you have a few items of clothing that are just way too small, stop waiting for the day that they will fit and donate them. Donate all of the clothes you don't need that are in good condition, or give them to a sibling or friend. 5. Clean the inside of the closet. You should do this before you put back your clothes. Vacuum or sweep the floor, wipe the walls down with all-purpose cleaner, and sweep away any cobwebs that may have accumulated there. If you want to make any changes, such as painting the inside a different color or adding and removing some shelves, do it now. 6. Hang up your clothes and organize them. Try to hang up as many of your clothes as you can. This will make it easier for you to find your clothes and to conserve space. You should not only hang up your clothes, but you should also organize them in a particular way so you can easily find them whenever you need to. Here are some ways to organize the clothes you hang up: Organize your clothes by season. If you've stored away some of your seasonal clothes, organize your clothes by season just for half the year. If it's summer, hang up your summer clothes first, followed by your fall clothes. Organize your clothes by type. You can separate your tank tops, shirts, pants, skirts, and dresses. Organize your work and casual clothes. Separate your work clothes from your casual clothes so you can easily get dressed for work in the morning. Organize your clothes by how often you wear them. You can choose any method of organization, but hang up a few key items, like your favorite hoodie or the pair of jeans you wear all the time, in the most accessible place. If you really want to step it up a notch, you can use differently colored hangers to mark a different type of clothing. For example, you can hang your tops on pink hangers, or your work clothes on green hangers. Colour code your clothes. example in rainbow colours You can also think about installing another pole to hang up your additional clothes. 7. Put additional clothes in other parts of your closet. Once you've hung up all of the clothes fit on your pole, you should find other parts of the closet to store the rest of your clothes. The clothes that you put in the bins should be used less frequently than the clothes you hang up, or they should be clothes that don't need to be hung up, like your workout clothes. Here are a few ideas: Don't waste the space under your hanging clothes. Put a few plastic bins of clothes under the hanging clothing. If you have room for a dresser, consider putting one in your closet. It will save you time and space. Consider installing a closet organizer to find a more efficient way to store your remaining clothes . If you have overhead space, make the most of it. Use it to store bulky sweaters, sweats, and other items that are thick and easy to spot. 8. Organize your shoes. Your shoes may take up a lot of the space in your closet, so once you've chosen which shoes you will keep, it's important to make the most of your space by storing them in the most organized and efficient manner. Here are some ways to organize the shoes in your closet: Organize them by type. Separate your dress shoes, sandals, and boots. Organize them by how often you wear them. Keep your favorite pair of boots, flip-flops, or sneakers in the place with the easiest access. Invest in a shoe rack to place on the floor of your closet. This will make it much easier to find the pair of shoes you want. Try storing your shoes in your overhead space. This is another easy way to save space. If your closet has a door that opens instead of a sliding door, consider getting a hanging shoe rack. If you have a front hall closet, consider putting the shoes you wear the most often there instead to save space in your personal closet. 9. Organize any boxes in your closet. If your closet is big enough, then it's likely that you've stored things other than clothes in it, such as big boxes filled with mementos, old photo albums, and CDs you haven't seen for ten years. To finish organizing your closet, you should go through these old boxes to see what you should keep and what you should toss. Here's how to do it: Get rid of any papers or items you've kept for over a year that have no sentimental value. Consolidate the boxes to save closet space. If your closet is already cramped, consider putting some of the items in a different place, such as putting your old high school yearbooks on the bottom of your bookshelf. If you've been using cardboard boxes, trade them up for plastic bins. They will last longer and will be more visually appealing. Label the boxes or bins so you know what's in them next time you move or organize your things again. 10. Organize any additional items in your closet. Take the time to go through any additional items in your closet to make sure that you still need them and that the closet is really the best place for them. Here are some examples: If you find any towels, sheets, or blankets, put them in your linen closet. If you've had an old lawn chair or another piece of furniture you don't really need hanging out back there, it's time to throw it out. If you've had to pick up an item and spend at least fifteen seconds trying to figure out what the heck it is or why you would need it, it's time to throw it out. Make sure that all of the other items you find belong in the closet and not another part of your home. For example, if you find a box of light bulbs, a box of comic books, or a box of chocolate, ask yourself if those items wouldn't be more logically organized elsewhere. 11. Make your closet more visually appealing. Turn your creativity loose and think of ways to add pleasure to the routine of getting dressed and looking through your closet every day. If you spend more time making your closet look nice, then you will be less likely to let it get messy in the future. Paint your closet a soft pretty color. Add mirrors for sparkle. Hang jewelry and scarves where you can see them -- as long as they don't get in your way. Hang up a small poster or painting that makes you smile every time you open your closet. 12. Enjoy your newly organized closet. Take a step back and admire your hard work! Hopefully, your closet is organized now so that all of its contents are easy to find and its overall appearance is to your liking. If not, take a few more minutes to make any minor changes that still need to be made. From this point forward, try to keep your closet organized as you add to it, or remove and return its current contents. Doing so will prevent you from needing to do another large overhaul on your closet in the future.",

As you go, drop items into: Keep / Donate / Tailor-Fix / Trash / Seasonal. Keep sentimental items in a separate small box.\n\n2. **Declutter Fast**\n   For each item ask: *Do I wear it? Does it fit? Do I love it?* If it fails 2+ questions, let it go. Put donations straight into your car or schedule a pickup.\n\n3. **Measure & Plan Zones**\n   Measure width, height to shelf, and depth. Sketch zones: **Long hang**, **Short hang (double rod if possible)**, **Shelves/Drawers**, **Shoes**, **Accessories**.\n\n4. **Choose the Right Tools**\n\n   * Hangers: one style for tops/bottoms, sturdy for coats.\n   * Shelves: add dividers for stacks.\n   * Bins: clear or labeled for accessories and off-season.\n   * Over-the-door/side-wall hooks for bags, hats, scarves.\n\n5. **Group by Category**\n   Tops → Bottoms → Dresses → Outerwear → Activewear → Accessories → Shoes. Keep sets (suit pieces) together.\n\n6. **Arrange Smart**\n\n   * **Frequency:** everyday items at eye/hand level; occasion or off-season up high.\n   * **Color order (light → dark)** within each category.\n   * Face items the same way; one item per hanger. File-fold tees in drawers.\n\n7. **Use Vertical Space**\n   Add a second rod for short items, under-shelf baskets, and stackable boxes on the top shelf. Use floor space for a shoe rack; store rarely used items highest.\n\n8. **Label & Maintain**\n   Label shelves and bins (e.g., “Sweaters,” “Gym,” “Bags”). Do a 5-minute tidy each week; do a seasonal swap twice a year.\n\n## Quick Layout Tips\n\n* **Tiny reach-in:** Double-rod 2/3 of the width; one narrow long-hang section; over-door hooks; under-bed box for off-season.\n* **Standard reach-in:** One long-hang, one double-hang, one shelf stack with dividers; 2–3 clear bins up top.\n* **Walk-in:** U-shape: long-hang on the shortest wall, double-hang on others; drawers/shelves in the center; island only if walk path remains ≥ 36\".\n\n## Maintenance Mini-Routine (10 minutes)\n\n* Return strays, re-fold one stack, re-set hangers to face forward, toss one item you won’t wear, and empty donation bag when it fills.\n\n---\n\n**Image:** I’ve generated an illustrated “Closet Organization in 8 Steps” poster separately for you to use alongside these instructions.",

    "text_ref": "1. Rinse your board right after using it. Rinse your board with water right after you use it, rather than waiting until the end of the meal or even the next day when you clean it. This will help minimize bacteria growth and keep your board cleaner. Resist the urge to throw your board in the sink after the meal and forget about it. 2. Clean your board with dish soap and hot water. To clean your cutting board, scrub it with a few drops of dish soap on a sponge and some hot water. [2] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview Be sure to remove any food particles as you wash, paying particular attention to any grooves or scrapes in your board. Food can collect in these spots. Never clean a wooden cutting board in the dishwasher or soak it in water. The wood will absorb water, which can lead to bacteria and mold forming. [4] X Expert Source James Sears House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview 3. Rinse your board. Rinse your board to remove any traces of soap. You don’t want whatever you cook next to taste like your dish soap. [5] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview 4. Dry your board thoroughly to prevent cracking. After you’re finished washing your cutting board, dry it thoroughly with a clean dishtowel, removing any excess water. This is particularly important if your board is made of wood, as they are more prone to cracks. 5. Use a combination of white vinegar and baking soda. To sanitize your cutting board after use, sprinkle it with some baking soda. Then, spray the baking soda–covered board with white vinegar. This will fizz, helping draw stains out of your board and deodorizing it. Let this mix sit for 5 minutes and then rinse your board with water, drying as normal. 6. Disinfect your board with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Just as hydrogen peroxide can clean a wound, it can also clean your cutting board. Sprinkle your board with 3% hydrogen peroxide solution, and let it stand for 1 minute to kill any surface bacteria. Then, rinse your board with water, and dry with a dishtowel as normal. [8] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview Hydrogen peroxide can bleach porous surfaces like wood. Don’t let the solution sit too long or it might fade your cutting board. 7. Remove stains with a scrub of coarse salt. For deep, set-in stains on your cutting board, use a coarse salt, such as kosher salt, as a scrub. [10] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview Wet a sponge and use a handful of salt to scour your board, focusing on any areas of discoloration. Rinse your board with water when finished, and dry with a clean towel. [11] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview Be sure to wash your hands well and moisturize them with lotion after scrubbing your board with salt. It can be very drying. Another option is wearing kitchen gloves. 8. Wash your board with diluted bleach once a month. Especially if you work with raw meats and fish on your cutting board, use a diluted bleach solution to do a deep clean of your board once a month. Make a solution that’s 1/8th bleach and 7/8ths water. Wet a sponge, and scrub your board with the solution. Rinse well with plain water and dry your board as normal with a clean towel. 9. Rub your board with a lemon to deodorize once a week. To keep your board smelling fresh, use half of a cut lemon to deodorize your board. Rub the cut-side of the lemon along the length of the board side to side. Then, rinse with plain water, and dry with a clean towel. 10. Condition your cutting board weekly. If your cutting board is made of wood, use mineral oil to condition your board after it’s clean. This will keep it in optimal condition. Do not use organic oils or fats, which can turn rancid, to lubricate your board. Look for products labeled kitchen-grade white mineral oil, such as Howard’s Cutting Board Oil. There are other mineral oils meant for lubricating machinery but not for consumption. Look specifically for kitchen-grade oil. You can condition your board every time you clean it, or a minimum of once a week. Simply rub your board with the conditioner, and let it air try so the oil can soak in.",

Place a damp towel under the board so it won’t slip.\n\n2. **Remove crown & base**\n\n* Lay the pineapple on its side. Slice off about ½ inch from the top (crown) and bottom to make flat ends.\n\n3. **Stand and peel**\n\n* Stand it upright. Following the curve of the fruit, slice downward in long strips to remove the skin. Keep cuts shallow to save fruit.\n\n4. **Remove the “eyes”**\n\n* You’ll see brown “eyes” left in diagonal rows. Make shallow V-shaped notches along those diagonals (or shave them off) until the flesh is clean.\n\n5. **Choose your cut**\n\n* **Method A — Rings:** Lay the pineapple on its side and slice crosswise into ½-inch discs. Use a small round cutter or a paring knife to remove the hard core circle from each disc.\n* **Method B — Spears & Chunks:** Stand it up. Cut in half lengthwise, then into quarters. Lay each quarter flat and slice off the tough core (a pale, fibrous triangle) from the center edge. Cut quarters into long spears, then into bite-size chunks.\n\n6. **Serve or store**\n\n* Eat right away, or refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 3–4 days. For longer storage, freeze chunks on a tray, then bag.\n\n**Tips**\n\n* A ripe pineapple smells sweet at the base and yields slightly when pressed.\n* For cleaner cuts, wipe juice from the board as you go.\n* Try a sprinkle of lime and chili powder, or grill spears 1–2 minutes per side for caramelization.\n\n(Visual guide generated separately above.)\n",

Using cleansers that are too harsh can strip your skin of its natural oils, leading to breakouts and dry skin. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source First, figure out what skin type you have , then check out our cleanser recommendations below: For oily or acne-prone skin: Oil-free cleanser (that won’t clog pores) [2] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source For dry skin: Hydrating cleanser (to moisturize while you wash) For combination or normal skin: Gentle foaming cleanser (to cleanse dirt and grime gently) For sensitive skin: Fragrance-free cleanser (to avoid irritating skin) For aging skin: Gentle cleanser (to cleanse dirt and grime without drying) 2. Take off your makeup to avoid clogged pores. Face cleansers are meant to cleanse your skin, not remove makeup. If you like to wear makeup during the day, use a gentle makeup remover on a cotton pad to take everything off before washing your face. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you have acne-prone or oily skin, go for a water-based makeup remover (instead of an oil-based one) to avoid clogged pores. 3. Use lukewarm water to gently wet your skin. Hot water strips your skin of its natural oils, and cold water doesn’t remove dirt and grime effectively. Turn your tap to a temperature that’s just above room temp, then splash your face with water. If you have long hair, pull it back into a bun or ponytail before you start washing your face. This will make it much easier to cleanse your skin. 4. Gently apply face wash to your skin in a circular motion. Pour a coin-sized amount of cleanser onto your hands, then rub your palms together to lather it up. Rub the cleanser all over your face, including your cheeks, nose, forehead, chin, and jawline for about 10 seconds. Using a washcloth or a cleansing device to wash your face might sound like a good idea, but actually, they can be too harsh on your skin. For daily cleansing, just use your hands. Don’t use cleanser around your eyes. The skin there is so delicate that it rarely needs cleansing—just splashing the area with water will do. 5. Be gentle with your skin as you rinse and dry to avoid irritation. Use lukewarm water again, and splash it onto your face to rinse off the cleanser. Grab a clean towel and pat your skin dry, trying not to rub or scrub your face. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Rubbing your skin with a towel can be irritating, which can lead to dry skin or acne breakouts. Be sure to dry your skin with a clean towel. Using a dirty towel can introduce bacteria into your skin, which can lead to clogged pores. 6. Use toner to tackle red marks or dark spots. Using a toner is totally optional, and not everyone needs one in their skincare routine. However, using a toner can help smooth out your skin tone and complexion. To add a toner to your skincare routine, pour a pea-sized amount onto a cotton swab and gently rub it into your skin right after cleansing. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For oily or acne-prone skin: Cleansing toner (to prevent breakouts) For dry skin: Hydrating toner (to moisturize throughout the day) For combination or normal skin: Toner with witch hazel and aloe (to smooth skin and close the pores) For sensitive skin: Soothing toner (for hydration without irritation) For aging skin: Toner with vitamin C (to hydrate and plump skin) If you use serums, acne cream, or other products on your skin, now is the time to apply those as well. 7. Apply moisturizer to lock in hydration after cleansing. Washing your face is very drying, and all skin types need some moisture afterward. Find a moisturizer that’s for your skin type, then rub moisturizer all over your skin with your fingertips.

Cleanse your skin in the morning and at night to keep it clean. Experts recommend washing your face 2 times per day, or after you sweat. This will help keep your skin clean and avoid oil-buildup and breakouts. [11] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Overwashing your face can be just as damaging as not washing it enough. Although it might seem like a good idea to cleanse your skin more often throughout the day, your face needs its natural oils to function. Try to stick to washing once in the morning and once at night for the best results. If you feel like your skin needs a refresh during the day, splash it with lukewarm water and then pat your face dry. This will help wipe away any excess oil or grime on your skin. Don’t feel like you need to include a whole slew of products in order to have a great routine. Try adding in products one at a time to figure out what works best for you! Reader Poll: We asked 871 wikiHow readers about what products make up their daily skincare routine, and 56% of them shared that they use just water and maybe one product . [Take Poll] 9. Exfoliating removes dead skin cells and opens up your pores. Over-exfoliating can be drying and can lead to breakouts, so try to exfoliate instead of washing your face no more than once a week. To exfoliate, wet your skin with lukewarm water, then gently rub a chemical exfoliant or a physical exfoliant onto your skin. Rinse your skin with lukewarm water, pat it dry, then follow up with a moisturizer. [12] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Chemical exfoliants are better for dry or sensitive skin, and physical exfoliants are better for normal or oily skin. Exfoliating is very drying, so always follow up with a moisturizer afterwards. 10. Use sunscreen to prevent dark marks and hyperpigmentation. An important part of your skin care routine is using SPF 30 or higher sunscreen every day. Apply it after your moisturizer and before your makeup (if you wear it) to protect against UV rays when you head outside. Make sure to reapply your sunscreen every 2 hours, or as often as the bottle tells you to. If you have oily skin, look for an oil-free sunscreen to avoid clogged pores or breakouts. For all other skin types, look for a sunscreen that’s formulated for your face. Remember, UV rays are always there, even on cloudy days! Sunscreen will protect your skin even when you can’t see the sun.",

Wash your hands\n   Gets dirt and oils off so you don’t rub them onto your face.\n\n2. Remove makeup / heavy sunscreen (PM)\n   Use micellar water or a cleansing balm/oil. Rinse if the product calls for it. If you wore long-wear makeup or water-resistant SPF, do a gentle second cleanse with your regular face cleanser.\n\n3. Wet your face with lukewarm water\n   Not hot (can strip) or icy (can irritate).\n\n4. Apply cleanser (nickel-size)\n   Pick one for your skin type:\n\n* Oily/combination → gel/foaming, non-comedogenic\n* Dry → cream/milk\n* Sensitive/rosacea-prone → fragrance-free, very gentle\n* Acne-prone → salicylic acid (0.5–2%) a few times/week if tolerated\n\n5. Massage 30–60 seconds\n   Use soft circular motions with fingertips. Cover T-zone, along hairline, around nose, and jawline. Don’t scrub or use harsh brushes.\n\n6. Rinse thoroughly\n   Lukewarm water until the slip is gone—residue can cause dryness or breakouts.\n\n7. Pat dry with a clean towel\n   Blot, don’t rub. Reserve a small towel for your face only.\n\n8. Moisturize within 1–2 minutes\n   Seal in moisture while skin is still slightly damp.\n   Morning: finish with broad-spectrum SPF 30+ (last step).\n   Night: use your treatment (e.g., retinoid) before or after moisturizer per product directions.\n\n## Extras & good habits\n\n* Frequency: 2× daily (AM & PM). After sweaty workouts, rinse or do a gentle cleanse.\n* Exfoliation: 1–3×/week max. Prefer gentle chemical exfoliants (AHA/BHA). Avoid daily harsh scrubs.\n* Water temp: lukewarm always.\n* Tools: keep headbands and towels clean; replace frequently.\n* Common mistakes to avoid: over-cleansing, using body soap on face, scrubbing red/irritated skin, skipping SPF in the morning.\n* If you have prescriptions or a diagnosed skin condition, follow your clinician’s plan and slot those products in as directed.\n",

    "thinking_trace": "I need to provide instructions for properly washing the face, with both text and images. First, I’ll deliver the written steps as usual, then use the image tool to create visuals, with separate panels for illustration. After generating the image, I won’t summarize it, just send the visuals.\n\nThe tool specifies that after generating the image, no text should be included in that message. To meet the requirement, I’ll first send the text and then call for the image separately. Since the image response is empty, I can’t combine the two in one message, but I’ll still present everything.\n\nThe tool requires the image response to be in one message, with no text included. However, since I need to deliver both, I think my best option is to first send the text in one message, follow up with the image in a second—though typically, only one message per turn is allowed. I'll figure this out!\n\nI’m thinking that maybe I can first generate the image, but since the tool creates an empty message, the best approach may be to send the text in a separate message afterward. However, I’m concerned since I only have one chance for a response, and the image tool is pretty strict.\n\nThe tool specification says the message after an image is generated should be empty, but I need to include text instructions. After thinking it through, I’ll send the image first (an empty message), followed by a separate message with the clear text steps. I won’t describe the image in the text message, so that should work.",

Imagine the other loose end of the string, which you're holding in your right hand, is the \"rabbit\". The rabbit comes up the hole, runs around the tree, and goes back down the hole. Another way to remember how to make this knot is with a rhyme: \"Lay the bight to make a hole Then under the back and around the pole Over the top and through the eye Clinch it tight and let it lie\" 2. Hold one end of the rope in your left hand. This will be your ‘standing end’ or the end that does not move (consider this end the ‘hole’ and the ‘tree’.) Hold the other end in your right hand (this is the free end--the end of the rope that will be used to form the knot, or the ‘rabbit.’)Make a small loop with the end of the string in your left hand. This loop is the ‘hole’ the rabbit comes out of. These instructions assume you start with an \"underhand\" loop, so that the free end of the string is under the intersection formed by the loop. 3. Draw the end of the string in your right hand (the rabbit) through the loop made by your left hand (the hole. ) The end should be coming towards you as it goes through the loop. Think of this as the rabbit coming out of its hole. 4. Bring the ‘rabbit’ end around (behind) the string. This string is the part pointing upwards from the loop (the ‘tree’.) Pull the ‘rabbit’ back through the loop and down into the ‘hole’. This time the end is going away from you. 5. Take the top loose string in your left hand. Hold the other end in your right hand and pull the ends in opposite directions to tighten the knot.",

    "thinking_trace": "I’m thinking of creating a clear diagram for tying a bowline knot. I’ll break it down into 6 or fewer steps with simple labels and arrows—showing the process clearly with minimal text. I'll stick to blue for the rope, red arrows, and thick, simple lines. No distractions!\n\nIt seems like I don’t need to worry about color limitations for the diagram. I’ll just make sure to call the image generation tool and then deliver the text. The first step in the text should clarify: \"Make a small loop in the standing part, with the standing part on top and the working end on the right.\"\n\nTo tie a bowline, start by creating a small loop in the standing part, with the standing part on top. The loop should run clockwise. Next, pass the working end up through the loop, around the back of the standing part, and back down through the loop. Then, pull tight to set the knot.\n\nI’ll rewrite this with less orientation-specific language. For the first step, I’ll say: \"Make a small loop in the standing part, with the standing part lying over the free end.\" The loop should be big enough for the working end to pass through. The second step: \"Feed the working end up through the loop.\"",

These part should be cleaned separately from the rest of the coffee maker. 2. Wash the removable parts. Submerge the removable parts in warm, soapy water, and wash them using a dish rag. You can wash removable parts of your coffee maker the same way you would wash dishes. Glass pots can be very breakable. When washing your coffee maker's pot, treat the glass gingerly. Some coffee makers may have parts that can be washed in a dishwasher. Check the instructions manual, if you still have it. If you're unsure if your coffee maker can be washed in the dishwasher, err on the side of caution and hand wash it. 3. Wipe down the outside of the machine. Take a wet, soapy rag and give the outside of the machine a good wipe down. Wipe down the sides and remove any coffee grinds from the warming plate. When you're down, wipe off any soap suds with a clean, damp rag. 4. Reassemble your machine. After all the parts are dry, you can put your coffee machine back together. It is ready to use again. Make a habit of cleaning your coffee maker like this after each use. 5. Add a vinegar and water solution to your coffee maker. [4] X Expert Source Jonathan Tavarez Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview Make a mixture using 2 parts warm water and 1 part white vinegar. [5] X Expert Source Marcus Shields House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview The precise amounts will vary depending on the size of your coffee maker, but make roughly enough to fill the reservoir. Pour the mixture into the reservoir like you normally would with water when making coffee. 6. Let the coffee machine run half a brew cycle. [7] X Expert Source Jonathan Tavarez Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview Turn the coffee machine on. Keep an eye on it as it brews. Once about half the pot is full with the filtered vinegar/water mixture, turn the pot off. 7. Let the coffee maker sit for an hour. Set a timer for an hour. Let the coffee pot sit for this time frame. This will give the vinegar time to sit in the machine and clean out any mold. 8. Complete the brew cycle. After letting the coffee maker sit for an hour, turn the machine back on. Let it run the rest of the brew cycle. [10] X Expert Source Jonathan Tavarez Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview When done, all the vinegar/water mixture should be filtered into the pot. You can pour this mixture down the sink. 9. Run three brew cycles with plain water. Fill your coffee pot with clean water. Pour this into the reservoir and run a complete brew cycle. [12] X Expert Source Jonathan Tavarez Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview When it's done, pour the water out and run two more brew cycles with clean water. This should clean any vinegar out of your coffee maker. 10. Wipe down the coffee maker. After disinfecting the coffee maker, take a clean, damp rag. Wipe down the exterior of the machine to remove any dirt and debris. You should also make sure to remove coffee grinds from the warming plate. 11. Read your instruction's manual. If you still have the instructions manual, read it before cleaning your coffee maker. Most coffee makers can safely be cleaned with a vinegar/water mixture, but it's always a good idea to check first. [15] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source If you don't have the instructions manual, try looking up your model online. You may be able to find an instructions manual on the Internet. 12. Leave the reservoir lid open. Many people keep the reservoir lid closed. However, it's a good idea to leave it open when not in use. This will help dry out the machine, preventing mold and bacteria from growing in a moist environment. 13. Rinse the brew basket in the sink regularly. The brew basket is very susceptible to mold as it gets wet during the brewing process. Make sure you rinse out the brew basket after each use and make a habit of cleaning it each time you do dishes. This will keep your coffee maker mold and germ free.

Wipe the exterior and warming plate with a damp cloth; leave the lid open to dry.\n\n## Deep clean & descale (every 1–3 months, or ~every 40 brews)\n\n1. **Empty & prep:** Reassemble the empty basket; place the empty carafe on the plate.\n2. **Mix descaler:**\n\n   * Option A: Fill the reservoir with a **1:1 mix of white vinegar and water**.\n   * Option B (vinegar-free): **1–2 tsp citric acid per cup (250 mL) of warm water**, stir to dissolve, then fill the reservoir.\n3. **Start brew & soak:** Run a brew cycle until the carafe is **about halfway** full, then **pause** the machine for **30 minutes** to dissolve mineral buildup.\n4. **Finish brew:** Resume and complete the cycle; discard the hot solution carefully.\n5. **Rinse cycles:** Fill the reservoir with plain water and run **2–3 full cycles**, discarding each carafe, until there’s **no vinegar/citric smell**.\n6. **Detail clean:**\n\n   * Wipe the showerhead/spray arm and the area under the brew basket; use a soft brush or toothpick to clear clogged holes.\n   * Clean the carafe stains with a paste of **baking soda + a few drops of water**; rinse thoroughly.\n7. **Reinstall filter:** If you use a charcoal water filter, install a fresh one.\n\n## Safety & tips\n\n* **Never use bleach** or abrasive scrubbers inside the machine.\n* Hard water? Descale **monthly**; soft water can go **every 2–3 months**.\n* For **single-serve pod machines**, run a “brew” with no pod using the same descaling mix, then 2–3 water-only brews; also clean the pod needle with the manufacturer’s tool or a paperclip.\n\nIf you’d like, I can also generate a second illustration specifically for single-serve machines or espresso makers.\n",

I’ll leverage general knowledge and provide written instructions with a separately generated image.\n\nSince I can't summarize once the image is created, I’ll need to include the text steps first.\n\nOkay, so the user asked for both an image and text separately, but I’m not sure how to handle multiple messages in the same turn. Looks like I can generate the image first (without any text in its message), then follow that up with the text-generated response in a second message. That should work!\n\nThe user wants illustrated and text steps for cleaning a coffee maker. I’ll create a simple infographic-style image, with multiple panels showing the steps. The user requested separate images and text, so I’ll keep the instructions clear but concise, covering both daily cleaning and monthly descaling.\n\nI'll assume it's a standard drip coffee maker, but I might mention an alternative for single-serve machines—use a cleaning brew cycle and clean the needles. I also need to include important safety tips, like avoiding vinegar and bleach mixture, rinsing, and avoiding dishwashers. For descaling, I’ll suggest a 1:1 or 1:2 vinegar-water ratio, or citric acid as an option.\n\nThe user wants clean, simple steps for cleaning a coffee maker, with an image and separate text.

Press **Shift + Command (⌘) + 3**.\n2. A thumbnail appears at the bottom-right; click it to mark up, or ignore and it saves automatically.\n3. By default, the file saves to your Desktop as a PNG.\n\n**Tip:** Hold **Control** while pressing the shortcut to copy the screenshot to the clipboard instead of saving a file.\n\n---\n\n## Method 2 — Capture a selected portion\n\n1. Press **Shift + Command (⌘) + 4**.\n2. Your cursor becomes a crosshair. Click-drag to select the area.\n3. Release to capture. Use the thumbnail to edit or wait for it to save.\n\n**Handy modifiers while dragging:**\n\n* **Space**: Reposition the selection.\n* **Shift**/**Option**: Constrain or resize from center.\n\n---\n\n## Method 3 — Capture a window or menu\n\n1. Press **Shift + Command (⌘) + 4**, then tap **Space** (cursor becomes a camera).\n2. Hover the camera over a window or open menu (it highlights).\n3. Click to capture that window/menu (it includes a subtle drop shadow).\n\n**Clipboard instead of file:** add **Control** to the shortcut.\n\n---\n\n## Method 4 — Use the Screenshot toolbar (more options)\n\n1. Press **Shift + Command (⌘) + 5** to open the on-screen toolbar.\n2. Choose **Capture Entire Screen**, **Capture Selected Window**, or **Capture Selected Portion**.\n3. Click **Options** to pick a save location, set a **5s/10s timer**, show/hide floating thumbnail, and more.\n4. Click **Capture**.\n\n---\n\n## Extras\n\n* **Touch Bar capture (if your Mac has one):** **Shift + Command (⌘) + 6**.\n* **Find your shots:** Desktop by default (unless changed in **Options** in the toolbar).\n* **Edit quickly:** Click the floating thumbnail to crop, annotate, or share.\n* **Open the Screenshot app directly:** Spotlight → type **“Screenshot”**.\n\nIf you’d like, I can generate additional visuals (e.g., a one-page printable cheat sheet or separate images for each method).\n\",",

The instructions say I should only return an empty message after creating the image. I now see that I may need to deliver images and text separately, but that creates tension with the need to do everything in one message.\n\nResolving image and text issue\nI’m considering a solution: for tasks like this, I can generate images first, but only provide text steps in a second message. However, the system only allows one final response per turn, so this creates a conflict with the tool’s restriction to send an empty message after generating the image.\n\nConsidering visual steps for screenshot guide\nI’m debating how to handle the image and text steps separately. The tool insists that, after creating an image, I must return an empty message. To work around this, I could generate multiple images first, then send another message with step-by-step text referencing the images. It’s tricky, as the instructions seem to prohibit summarizing the images in that first message. However, I think this approach will still meet the user's needs.",

I'll generate images separately, but I can't summarize them. I'll just share the images and steps without mixing the two, following the instructions closely, even though it seems a bit tricky!\n\nHandling image and text in one response\nNormally, I would generate images with the tool and respond with a blank message afterward, but I need both images and text this time. Hmm, I could generate the image first and then provide the text in a second message, but it’s tricky since I can’t send two messages at once. I’ll figure this out!\n\nConsidering the message flow\nOkay, so the image will be generated first, then displayed, and the text will follow in a separate message. The tricky part is the rule that prevents summarizing or describing the image—that’s why the assistant's reply after the tool call needs to be empty. I just can't send two replies in one turn!\n\nPlanning the image and text sequence\nOkay, so the plan is to first generate images via the tool showing the steps to update apps on an iPad. These will be labeled with \"Step 1\" and so on. Once the images are ready, I'll send a separate message with the text steps. It’s a bit roundabout, but should work!\n\nPlanning the task structure\nOkay, so the goal is to generate clear, simple images of the iPad app update process, then present the instructions in another message. There are six steps to visualize, and the tool seems to allow single prompts for multiple images. Then, I'll follow up with text instructions. I'll keep it minimal and informative!",

    "thinking_trace": "\nEvaluating response process\nI’m thinking through the sequence for delivering an image along with text, since the user asked for both. Maybe I should first send a text response and then ask if the user wants the image? If both are needed, I can send multiple messages sequentially—text first, then the image.\n\nPlanning image and text sequence\nI’ll start by providing text steps first, labeled as “TEXT STEPS.” After that, I’ll generate images, focusing on both desktop (Windows/macOS) and mobile (iOS/Android) flows for creating, naming, and managing playlists. I'll provide about 6-8 illustrative images, ensuring they are simple and don’t replicate copyrighted UI elements.\n\nOrganizing image and text presentation\nFor the user asking how to create a playlist, I want to keep things concise while following their instructions. I'll provide two sections: one for images and one for text steps. The images will be generated as a multi-panel set or separate images for each step, based on a clear prompt describing the process.\n\nPlanning image approach\nFor the user, I want to balance clarity with their request to generate the image and text separately. I’ll plan to create two images: one for Desktop steps (4 steps) and one for Mobile steps (4 steps), each showing clear, numbered visuals. If needed, I can adjust the number of images for better clarity.\n\nFinal image and text plan\nI’ll generate two instructional images: one for desktop and one for mobile showing how to create a playlist. The desktop image will have 4 panels, each corresponding to a playlist creation step. The mobile image will do the same for the mobile app. The images will be separate from the text steps for clarity.",

These hotkeys are represented by two different images of a sun, one for increasing and another for decreasing brightness. Find the keys on your keyboard to get started. These hotkeys will look slightly different on every computer. They are often differentiated by a filled-in sun (decrease) and an empty sun (increase) or a sun with dots for rays (decrease) and a sun with lines for rays (increase). Also be on the lookout for arrows pointing upwards or downwards, indicating an increase or decrease in brightness. These hotkeys will be mapped onto different buttons on different keyboards. Check out your left and right arrow keys, or the function keys (F1, F2, etc.) lining the top of your keyboard. 2. Hold down the \"Fn\" key on your keyboard. The brightness hotkeys are not the primary function of the keys they are mapped onto. You'll therefore needed to hold down the Fn key while you adjust your screen's brightness. 3. Tap the appropriate hotkeys. While holding Fn , tap the corresponding hotkeys to turn your PC's brightness up or down.",

If your keyboard has **Fn Lock** (often **Fn + Esc**), toggle it and try again.\n\n### Method 2 — Action Center (works on most devices)\n\n1. Press **Win + A** to open Action Center.\n2. Press **Tab** until the **brightness slider** is selected.\n3. Use **Left/Right Arrow** to adjust brightness.\n4. Press **Esc** to close.\n\n### Method 3 — Windows Mobility Center (laptops)\n\n1. Press **Win + R**, type **mblctr**, press **Enter**.\n2. Press **Tab** to focus **Display brightness**.\n3. Use **Left/Right Arrow** to adjust.\n4. Press **Alt + F4** to close.\n\n### Method 4 — Settings via keyboard (fallback)\n\n1. Press **Win + I** to open Settings.\n2. Type **brightness**, press **Enter** to open Display settings.\n3. **Tab** to the **Change brightness** slider and use **Left/Right Arrow**.\n\n#### Notes & tips\n\n* On **desktops/external monitors**, keyboard brightness keys usually won’t work—use the monitor’s buttons or its vendor app.\n* If there’s no brightness slider: update your display driver and ensure your display shows as **Generic PnP Monitor** in Device Manager.\n\",",

    "thinking_trace": "\nClarifying image and text requirements\nI need to provide visual and text steps separately. The user doesn't want code-based visualization like web.run or python_user_visible to generate the image, but they do want images. I can use the image generation tool for that, as it's not considered code. After creating the image, I’ll respond without a summary but still need to include text steps.\n\nHandling image and text steps\nThe tool for image generation asks for no summary after creating the image—just an empty message. But I still need to provide text steps. It looks like I can send two separate messages: one with the image and an empty response, and another with the text steps. I'll make sure to do it in sequence.\n\nAddressing image and text order\nThe tool requires an empty message after generating the image, but I still need to provide text steps. I'm unsure if I can send two responses in one turn. It seems like I might need to first generate the image with an empty message, then follow up with the text steps—within the rules of one turn.\n\nGenerating visual and text steps\nFirst, I need to handle the sequence: generate the image with an empty response, then follow up with an assistant message to provide text. For Windows 10, using the keyboard, I'll focus on methods like pressing Windows + A for the Action Center and using arrow keys to adjust brightness. I'll illustrate this as well.\n\nProviding clarity on brightness control methods\nFor adjusting brightness on Windows 10 using only the keyboard, there are several methods:\n\nUse the Fn + brightness key (located on F1/F2/F5/F6, depending on your laptop).\n\nPress Win + A to access the Action Center, then use Tab and arrow keys to adjust the slider.\n\nOpen the Mobility Center by pressing Win + R, typing \"mblctr,\" and using Tab and arrow keys.\n\nThe images will accompany clear, simple step-by-step visual guides for each method.",

In the meantime, here are the full text steps:\n\n# Text Steps — Put an eBook on an iPad\n\n## Before you start\n\n* **Supported formats:** `.epub` and `.pdf` (best for Apple Books).\n* **May not work:** Kindle formats like `.mobi`/`.azw` (unless converted).\n* **DRM note:** Files protected by DRM usually only open in the seller’s app.\n\n---\n\n## Method 1 — AirDrop (fast & wireless from a Mac)\n\n1. On your **Mac**, open **Finder** and locate the eBook (`.epub` or `.pdf`).\n2. Right-click → **Share** → **AirDrop** → choose your **iPad**.\n3. On the **iPad**, tap **Accept** when prompted.\n4. If you see a picker, choose **Open in Books** (or tap **Share** → **Books**).\n5. Open **Books** → **Library** to find it.\n\n---\n\n## Method 2 — Files / iCloud Drive (sync via cloud)\n\n1. Put the eBook into **iCloud Drive** (on Mac/PC or via iCloud.com).\n2. On the **iPad**, open the **Files** app → browse to the file.\n3. Tap-and-hold the file → **Share** → **Books** (or **Open in** → **Books**).\n4. Check **Books** → **Library** (look under **PDFs** or **Downloaded**).\n\n*(Also works with Dropbox/Google Drive/OneDrive: open the file in that app → **Share**/**Open in** → **Books**.)*\n\n---\n\n## Method 3 — Email it to yourself\n\n1. Email the eBook to your own address as an attachment.\n2. On the **iPad**, open **Mail**, tap the attachment to open it.\n3. Tap **Share** → **Books**.\n4. Find it in **Books** → **Library**.\n\n---\n\n## Method 4 — Finder (macOS) or iTunes (Windows) via USB\n\n1. Connect iPad to the computer with a cable.\n2. **macOS (Finder):** Open Finder → select your **iPad** in the sidebar.\n\n   * Go to **Books** (or **Files** section), then drag the `.epub`/`.pdf` onto it.\n   * Click **Apply/Sync** if shown.\n3. **Windows (iTunes):** Open **iTunes** → select your device → **Books**.\n\n   * Drag the files into **Books**, enable **Sync Books**, then **Apply**/**Sync**.\n4. On the iPad, open **Books** → **Library**.\n\n---\n\n## Method 5 — Download directly on the iPad (Safari)\n\n1. In **Safari**, download the `.epub` or `.pdf`.\n2. Tap the **download icon** (arrow) → tap the file.\n3. Tap **Share** → **Books**.\n4. Check **Books** → **Library**.\n\n---\n\n## Where to find it afterward\n\n* Open **Books** → **Library** → look under **All**, **Downloaded**, or **PDFs**.\n* Use **Collections** or **Search** if you have many items.\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting & tips\n\n* **Don’t see “Books” in the Share sheet?** Tap **More** (•••) → enable **Books**.\n* **File won’t open?** It might be DRM-protected or an unsupported format.\n* **Kindle file?** Convert to `.epub` first (e.g., with a desktop converter).\n* **Stuck syncing via iCloud?** On iPad: **Settings** → **iCloud Drive** ON; ensure Wi-Fi is connected.\n* **PDFs vs ePub:** PDFs keep original layout; ePub lets you resize text.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, say “Generate the visuals now,” and I’ll produce a clean set of images that match these methods one-by-one.\n\",",

    "thinking_trace": "Planning image and text instructions\nI need to provide a step-by-step guide for blocking people on Facebook, with both text and image components for clarity. No code should generate the images, and I can use the image generation tool to help with creating those images. After generating images, I won’t summarize them, just leave an empty message afterward. I'll follow these guidelines.\n\nConsidering image and text delivery\nTo meet the user's request for both text and images, I can't directly combine them in the same message after generating the image. The tool requires the assistant’s message to be empty after generating the image. So, I’ll either provide image briefs for drawing or find another way to deliver the steps as requested.\n\nManaging image and text separation\nThe user wants images and text steps separately. Since the tool doesn’t allow both in one message, I can either explain the steps without images or generate the images first and then follow up with text in a second message. However, the guidelines ask for just one reply, so it's tricky.\n\nWorking with image and text constraints\nThe tool guidelines say I can’t include both text and images in one message. So, I can’t add text after using the image tool. I could try providing image descriptions instead of generating images right away or create prompts for the user to visualize. It’s tricky with these limitations!\n\nThinking through image and text delivery\nThe user wants image and text steps separate, but the tool restricts me from mixing them in one message after generating images. I could try to generate the images first and then send text afterward, but the system might only allow one message at a time. So, I may consider providing detailed image instructions in text instead.",

    "text_ref": "1. Get a wireless router. Most ISPs will supply you with both a Wi-Fi router and modem, or a Wi-Fi router/modem combo. If your ISP only provides a modem, or you don't want to rent a Wi-Fi router from them, you can buy your own. Various factors will determine which router is best for you, including speed, bandwidth capabilities, and Wi-Fi coverage/distance. Speed These days, all wireless routers (even the budget models) are pretty fast. If you need ultra-fast Wi-Fi speeds—perhaps multiple devices will be streaming movies in 4k or 8k, gaming, or sharing large amounts of data at the same time—opt for a router with Wi-Fi 7 technology . If you're on a budget and want blazingly fast but don't need extreme , opt for a Wi-Fi 6 router . Distance If you have a very large home, consider a mesh router system instead of a standalone Wi-Fi router. Mesh Wi-Fi systems consist of a router with a series of nodes to expand the coverage in all areas of your home. 2.4GHz or 5Ghz 2.4 GHz covers a wider distance, is supported by more devices, and is good at penetrating walls and large furniture. However, it's more prone to interference because more devices (including cordless phones) use this frequency. 5 GHz is faster and less prone to interference, but it does have a smaller coverage area and cannot penetrate solid objects as well as 2.4GHz. Security The highest level of security is WPA3, but some devices (including Nintendo Switch) don't support it. Choose a router that has a WPA2/WPA3 Transitional mode, which allows newer devices to use WPA3 and older devices to use WPA2. 2. Connect the modem to the appropriate port on your wall. If you have a separate modem, connect it to the DSL, cable, or fiber port on your wall using the cable provided to you by your ISP, and turn the unit on. If the modem and router are one unit, connect that to the wall port, and turn the unit on. 3. Connect the router to your modem and turn it on. If the router is separate from the modem, you'll need to connect it to the modem using an ethernet cable. Plug one end of the cable into the port on the back of the router labeled WAN/WLAN/Internet or similar, and the other end into the modem's LAN port. 4. Place your router. For the best possible signal , position the wireless router in a central location, away from walls and metal objects, and not on the floor. [3] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source Any obstacles will degrade the signal. Remember that it must be physically connected to your modem, so this may limit your options when placing the router. 5. Connect your computer or phone to the router. Some routers have a mobile app you can install that makes Wi-Fi setup a breeze—check your router's documentation to see if you can download an app and use it to set up your router. If not, you'll need to connect your computer to the router using an ethernet cable to set up your wireless network. 6. Log in to the router's admin page. If you connected your computer via ethernet, you'll need to open the router's configuration page and sign in with the admin password. Open a web browser and enter the router's web address. According to Showers, the IP address is typically https://192.168.1.1, https://192.168.0.1, or https://10.0.0.1, but can vary based on the router model. [4] X Expert Source Tyrone Showers Technologist Expert Interview Consult the documentation that came with the router to find the exact address. The router will ask you for a login name and password, or sometimes just a password. The password you'll need to use is in your router's documentation or sometimes printed on a sticker on the back of the router. If you bought a used router, you can find the default admin password for most routers at https://portforward.com/router-password . 7. Enter your internet connection information. In most cases, your router should obtain this information automatically from your modem. If it doesn't, you may need to enter some information about your internet connection—often a username and password and DNS server addresses. If you're not sure what to enter, contact your ISP. 8. Set up your Wi-Fi access point. Locate the Wireless or Wi-Fi section of your router's configuration page. You can enable Wi-Fi, change the network name, and set the security level here. The \"SSID\" field is where you'll enter a name for your Wi-Fi router. This is the name people will see when they want to connect to the internet. If you live in an area with a lot of public traffic, avoid putting any identifiable information in the SSID, as anyone with a wireless device can see it. Make sure to set the security/encryption to the latest version allowed by your router. This will most likely be WPA3 (best) or WPA2 (less good, but more compatible with older devices). Create a password for your Wi-Fi network. While this is not required, Showers recommends it. \"Creating a strong password, combining letters, numbers, and special characters is important to enhance security,\" he says. [5] X Expert Source Tyrone Showers Technologist Expert Interview 9. Apply your settings. Make sure you click the Apply or Save Changes button in your router's configuration when you are done changing the settings. The router will process for a moment (or reboot), and your new settings will take effect. 10. Connect your devices to Wi-Fi. Once the router is online, you can connect your Wi-Fi capable devices so they can access the internet. Android Swipe down from the top of the screen. Tap and hold the Wi-Fi icon to open your Wi-Fi settings. Slide the \"Wi-Fi\" switch to \"ON\" (or tap the option to Use Wi-Fi ). Select your Wi-Fi network name. iPhone or iPad Open Settings . Tap Wi-Fi . Tap the switch ON . Select your Wi-Fi network's name. Windows 10/11 Click the network icon in the taskbar, which usually looks like a Wi-Fi fan or similar to the bars you normally see at the top of your cell phone. It may be a globe if you're not currently connected. Click your Wi-Fi network's name. Click Connect . Mac Click the Wi-Fi icon (the fan) in the menu bar. Select your Wi-Fi network. 11. Enter the password. Type the password you created when configuring your Wi-Fi router, and click Connect or similar. Once the password is accepted, your device will be connected to the Wi-Fi access point. 12. Test your internet connection. Once you are connected to the network, wait a moment for your IP address to be assigned. Open a web browser and try to connect to a website you don't normally visit to ensure you aren't loading the website from memory.",

I’ll focus on ensuring they are distinct while adhering to the user's request.\n\nPlanning multi-OS guide\nSince the user didn't specify the OS, I’ll include steps for multiple environments like Windows, macOS, Ubuntu, and Chromebook. I’ll organize the response with sections for each OS, numbered steps, and a \"Quick troubleshooting\" section. I’ll also generate a visual guide with a generic laptop screen and steps overlay to make it clear.\n\nPlanning infographic design\nI’ll create a clean, four-panel infographic covering Windows 11/10, macOS, Chromebook, and Ubuntu. It’ll include step numbers and icons but omit any brand logos—only using the OS names as labels. The text and visuals will focus on general, stable info, not updated web details. This will help maintain clarity.\n\nFinalizing infographic details\nFor the infographic, I'll include steps like clicking the Wi-Fi icon, selecting SSID, entering a password, and connecting. Each panel will follow a minimalist, pastel, high-contrast vector design. I'll set the size to \"1920x1080\" for clarity. The text will include a general overview, with OS-specific steps.\n\nProviding image and text separately\nI’ll follow the user’s request to generate the image and text separately. First, I’ll create the visual guide via the image tool, then send an empty message afterward, as required. Afterward, I’ll follow up with the text steps. The challenge here is ensuring the separation without violating the instruction to not summarize the image.",

I'll use image generation to create visuals for the \"Chrome add bookmark\" process, covering both desktop and mobile. I’ll make sure to create clear, labeled steps, and possibly use multiple images to ensure simplicity.\n\nHandling image and text sequencing\nOkay, there's a bit of a conflict here with the policy. The idea is we generate the image first and respond with an empty message, but then we also want to provide text steps. Since we have one turn, I think the best approach is to split the process into two separate messages: the image generation first, then the text steps afterward.\n\nEvaluating image policy and text conflict\nOkay, here's the thing: the image tool asks not to summarize the image afterward, but the user wants text steps. I don't think the text steps count as summarizing the image, since they're separate instructions. However, the tool's rule is strict about leaving the message empty after generating the image, which presents a bit of a dilemma.\n\nHandling image generation and text\nThe user requested generating an image, but not through code or web search. I could use AI for image generation instead. The policy seems to suggest that after generating the image, the response has to be empty.

During later centuries, people extracted those clamps, leaving behind holes known as \"putlog holes\" — originally for scaffolding. Other factors like weathering, earthquakes, and metal scavenging during the Middle Ages also contributed.\n\nThe pockmarks on the Colosseum’s travertine are likely from iron clamps being removed. After Rome's fall, the amphitheater was used as a quarry, and people pried out the iron clamps, sometimes filling the holes with lead. Larger rectangular holes may come from wooden scaffolding beams. Earthquakes also caused some damage.\n\nI’ll describe a photorealistic image of the outer Colosseum in Rome, focusing on the travertine stone with numerous pockmarks caused by the removal of old iron clamps.

    "GPT_text": "Text (explanation):\n\nSingapore’s Helix Bridge looks like DNA because its main structure is literally two spiraling steel “ladders” that wrap around the walkway like a double helix. Short cross-members link the pair of spirals at regular intervals—just like DNA’s “base pairs”—and lighting emphasizes the twist so the pattern reads clearly, especially at night.\n\nIt can still carry crowds safely because that DNA form isn’t just decoration; it’s a working spatial truss. Here’s how it holds up the deck:\n\n* Two opposite helices share the load. One spiral primarily takes compression in some segments while the other takes tension; together they brace each other against buckling and twisting.\n* Radial struts connect the deck to the helices, so the walkway’s weight (and people on it) is transferred into the surrounding tube network rather than a single beam.\n* The helical tubes form closed, triangulated paths for forces, which is very efficient. Loads flow through the tubes to a series of piers in the bay, so the bridge is supported in stages rather than by one long, bending span.\n* Stainless-steel tubes provide high strength relative to weight and resist corrosion in the marine environment, keeping the structure stiff and durable.\n* The geometry also resists side winds and footfall vibrations, and the deck has full-height guardrails and non-slip surfacing for safety.\n\nIn short: the bridge reads as DNA because its load-bearing skeleton is a pair of intertwined steel helices with “rungs”—the same elements that make it strong enough for pedestrians.\n\n(Generated photo provided above.)\n",

As it tilts, the **deck rises** and the **arch dips**, creating a tall navigation gap for vessels.\n* **Why it’s efficient:** The arch acts as a **counterweight** to the deck, so the system stays balanced and needs relatively little energy to move.\n* **What people experience:** Before a lift, barriers and signals stop foot and cycle traffic. The bridge then tilts smoothly over a few minutes, holds position while boats pass, and tilts back to level.\n* **Nickname:** Because it looks like a giant eye opening and closing, it’s often called the **“Winking Eye”** bridge.\n\n---\n\n# Photo (separate)\n\n*(A generated photo of the Gateshead Millennium Bridge in its open/tilted position with a boat passing beneath is attached above.)*\n",

The opening removes only a central portion of the trunk, leaving thick “legs” of wood on both sides. Like a stone arch, those side walls carry most of the compressive load down to the roots, so the trunk can still support itself.\n\nBiologically, coast redwoods are unusually resilient: most water and nutrient transport happens in a thin, living layer just under the bark (the cambium and outer sapwood). Even though the tunnel removes wood and bark at the opening, continuous living tissue remains around the sides and back of the trunk, so flow up and down the tree can continue. Redwood heartwood is rot-resistant and the species can compartmentalize wounds, helping the tree survive long term.\n\nTo protect it, the attraction limits traffic to small vehicles, one at a time and at very low speed, minimizing vibration and impact. Modern arborists would not create new “drive-through” trees today, but this one remains as a historic curiosity—surviving thanks to the combination of clever arch-like shaping and the redwood’s natural toughness.\n",

The public route—marketed as “Up at The O2”—is a purpose-built, slightly springy tensile walkway laid over the dome. Visitors step on this walkway, not on the delicate membrane roof.\n • Supported by the arena’s structural skeleton. The walkway is cable-hung and bracketed back to the O2’s primary structure (the steel perimeter ring, radial cables, and the iconic yellow masts). This means the loads from groups of people are carried by the steelwork and cables designed to handle them.\n • Non-slip, flexible deck. The deck uses a high-friction, weather-resistant surface with just enough give to accommodate the dome’s curvature and wind movements without damaging the underlying roof.\n • Continuous fall-arrest system. Each climber wears a harness clipped to a continuous safety rail along the route, with handlines and occasional steps at steeper sections—so people remain secured the entire time.\n • Controlled capacity and guided access. Group sizes, pacing, and weather checks are managed by guides, keeping live loads within the design limits and ensuring safe operation.\n\nIn short, a separate, engineered walkway—suspended and anchored to the O2’s main steel-and-cable frame—plus a clip-in safety system makes it possible for visitors to walk over the dome safely.",

Tighten your abs and push your lower back flat against the mat the entire time you’re performing crunches to ensure your core stays engaged. If you don’t have an exercise mat, then lay out a soft towel or do crunches on a carpeted floor so you’re more comfortable. 2. Bend your knees so your feet are flat on the floor. Position your feet so your heels are about 12 to 18 in (30 to 46 cm) from your tailbone. Bend your knees to 90 degrees and keep them about hip-width apart. Make sure the soles of your feet are flat against the ground. 3. Cross your arms in front of your chest with your hands just below your shoulders. Keep your elbows pointed down toward your feet. Lay your hands flat on your chest right in front of your shoulders. Avoid putting your hands behind your head since you could accidentally strain your neck when you perform your exercise. For more resistance during your workout, hold a 5 to 10 pounds (2.3 to 4.5 kg) plate weight over your chest. 4. Lift your shoulder blades off of the mat with a smooth, controlled motion. Tighten your abs and take a deep breath in. As you exhale, engage your muscles to raise your torso off of the mat all while keeping your lower back and feet flat on the floor. Lift yourself just enough to get your shoulder blades off of the floor. Support yourself in this position for 1–2 seconds. Avoid sitting all the way up when you perform a crunch since muscles in your back and hips will take over, and you could strain yourself. Keep your lower back, tailbone, and feet in contact with the mat at all times. If your feet lift off of the ground while you’re performing a rep, have someone hold onto your feet or position them underneath something heavy. Keep your neck relaxed instead of tucking in your chin. Try to keep an apple-sized space between your chin and your chest. Looking at the ceiling can help keep you from curling your neck too much. 5. Lower yourself back down with a slow, steady motion. Gently inhale as you slowly lower your torso down to the floor. Use a smooth, controlled motion to work your ab muscles and prevent you from injuring yourself. Take a brief pause to finish 1 rep. If you rush into the next rep, you’ll end up using the momentum of your body moving instead of your muscles to lift yourself up. Additionally, you’re more likely to injure your back Try doing a set of 10–12 crunches to start working out your abs . As you start building up your core strength, try doing 2–3 sets or increasing the number of reps you do.",

Brace\n\n* Take a breath in.\n* Gently **brace your core** as if preparing for a light poke, keeping hips stacked and elbow open.\n\n3. Crunch up\n\n* **Exhale** and bring your **left ribcage toward your left hip**.\n* Lift both shoulders a few inches; keep elbow wide and gaze forward.\n* Knees and legs stay quiet—movement comes from your **obliques**, not from tugging the head.\n\n4. Pause\n\n* Hold the top position for **1 second**, keep breathing softly, feel the side squeeze.\n\n5. Lower with control\n\n* **Inhale** and lower your shoulders back to the start without collapsing. Maintain tension.\n\n6. Repeat & switch sides\n\n* Do **8–15 controlled reps**, then **flip to your left side** to work the right obliques.\n* Aim for **2–3 sets per side**.\n\n### Form tips & common mistakes\n\n* Keep hips stacked; don’t roll backward.\n* Don’t yank on your head—your hand just supports.\n* Small range is fine; prioritize **slow, controlled** reps.\n* If you feel your neck more than your side, reduce range and press your tongue lightly to the roof of your mouth to help stabilize.\n\n### Make it easier\n\n* Place top hand across your chest instead of behind your head.\n* Keep bottom arm straight and use it lightly on the floor for balance.\n\n### Make it harder\n\n* Straighten your legs and keep feet slightly off the floor.\n* Add a light dumbbell or small plate held against the side of your ribcage (still no neck pulling).\n\nIf you want variations (e.g., **side plank crunch** or **standing side crunch**), say the word and I’ll add those too.\n",

Visual cues and reps will also be included.\n\nCreating exercise visual guide\nI’ll create a clear, step-by-step guide to the side crunch (side-lying oblique crunch) composed of six panels, showing each part of the movement: start, brace, crunch, pause, lower, and repeat the other side. I'll include instructions for maintaining proper body alignment and keep it simple, safe, and without medical claims.\n\nPreparing instructions and visuals\nI’ll first create a clear 6-panel image showing the side crunch, labeled from 1 to 6, with a gender-neutral figure performing the exercise on a mat. Afterward, I’ll write a step-by-step guide with numbered bullets, highlighting common mistakes, progressions, and reps. The text will be separate and friendly!\n\nOutlining side crunch panels\nThe visual guide will include minimal grey outline figures with blue highlights for the obliques (if allowed), but I won't specify colors—it's about keeping it simple.

Choose the right heels\n\n* Pick a stable pair: block heel or wedge, 2–3 in (5–7.5 cm), secure ankle strap, good fit.\n* Add non-slip sole grips if the bottoms are slick.\n\n2. Prep & warm up (1–2 min)\n\n* Ankle circles (both directions), calf raises, gentle hamstring/calf stretch.\n* Check straps/buckles are snug.\n\n3. Posture setup\n\n* Stand tall: ears over shoulders, shoulders over hips, ribs stacked, neutral pelvis.\n* Engage your core lightly; look where you’re going (not at your feet).\n\n4. Start with short, quick steps\n\n* Keep strides small to stay balanced.\n* Aim for a light, quick cadence rather than long reaches.\n\n5. Soft forefoot landing\n\n* Touch down gently near the ball of the foot, then roll through—avoid stabbing the heel first.\n* Keep toes pointing forward; don’t let ankles collapse inward.\n\n6. Use compact arm swing\n\n* Elbows ~90°, swing close to the body to counterbalance without twisting your torso.\n\n7. Pick safe surfaces\n\n* Prefer smooth, dry, even ground.\n* Avoid grates, cobblestones, grass, wet tile, and steep slopes.\n* If you must cross hazards, slow to a walk.\n\n8. Braking & turning\n\n* To slow: shorten steps, keep torso tall, don’t lean back.\n* For turns: take several tiny steps (no sharp pivots on a planted heel).\n\n9. Emergency stop & recovery\n\n* If you wobble: plant both feet shoulder-width, knees soft, lower your heels toward flat, then reset.\n* If a heel catches: stop, step back out, don’t yank forward.\n\n10. Cool down & care\n\n* Walk it off for 30–60 seconds, stretch calves/arches.\n* Inspect tips/heel caps; swap to flats if feet feel fatigued.\n\n### Practice Drills (build skill before full running)\n\n* March in place in heels (30–60s).\n* Walk–jog intervals: 10–20m jog, 20–30m walk; repeat 4–6x.\n* Figure-8 weaving around two cones/chairs to train controlled turns.\n\n### Safety Notes\n\n* Running in heels increases risk of ankle/knee injury—only do brief sprints when necessary.\n* Never run in very high, narrow stilettos or loose shoes.\n* Carry foldable flats as a backup.\n\nIf you’d like, I can generate alternate visuals (e.g., a printable poster or a horizontal storyboard) or tailor the steps to your specific heel height.\n",

    "thinking_trace": "Considering guidance format\nThe user is asking for guidance on \"How to Run in High Heels\" with both visual and text steps. They specifically want the image and text separate, with no web search or code for the image. After generating the image via the available tool, I'll need to respond with just the steps in text, no image summary.\n\nResolving image and text conflict\nI’m thinking I can generate the image first and then just send it, since the tool says not to summarize or add text in the same message. But the user wants text steps included as well. I could send text steps in a separate message right after, though this might break the one-turn rule. This might need some reconciliation!\n\nManaging separate steps\nI’m thinking about generating the image first and then sending the text steps in a second message. The instructions allow multiple responses, so this should be fine. But the tool policy says not to add any text after the image, so I have to figure out how to handle that second part.\n\nFinding the right approach\nI’m considering sending the image first and then the text step right after, though the system expects one final response. The tool suggests the image message should be empty, but I need to include both visuals and text. Back-to-back messages could work, but I need to verify the system's expectations!\n\nPlanning image and text steps\nI’ll create a step-by-step visual guide for running in high heels, with 10 numbered panels. The image will have a clean, minimalist style and show icons for each step. After generating the image, I’ll send the text steps separately in another message. Safety tips and disclaimers will be included in the text.\n\nThought for 54s\n完成",

    "text_ref": "1. Start with a low weight. The most important thing with squats is to have the correct form, so you shouldn't attempt weighted squats until you can perform body weight squats with perfect form. Start with a low weight — maybe just using the bar (which weighs 45lbs) — and slowly build yourself up to heavier weights as your squat technique and muscle strength improves. 2. Position the bar correctly. Set up the squat rack so the bar is slightly below shoulder level. Position the safety bars so they are low enough to allow you to squat down fully with the bar on your shoulders. When you're ready, duck under the bar and grip it widely with your palms facing forward. Rest the bar across your upper back (not your neck). If this feels uncomfortable for you, try using a bar pad. 3. Squat using the same technique as the body weight squat. Place your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, with your toes pointing slightly outwards. Hinge your hips and push your butt backwards until your hamstrings are parallel with the floor. Keep your chest up, your shoulders back and your eyes looking straight ahead. Remember to keep your back straight — this is especially important when you are squatting with heavy weights. Push out of the squat with your heels and don't let your knees cave in towards the center. If this happens, you may need to reduce your weight. 4. Inhale on the way down, exhale on the way back up. Breathing deeply is very important when squatting heavy weights. If you hold your breath you can become dizzy, nauseous or even blackout. Take a deep breath in as you squat down and exhale powerfully as you rise up. Maintaining this breathing pattern will give you the energy you need to keep going. If you're pushing yourself to get another few repetitions, don't be afraid to pause between repetitions to take a couple of deep breaths.",

    "GPT_text": "Here you go—one visual guide and one text guide, separated as you asked.\n\n# Visual steps (image)\n\nI created a clean 9-panel infographic titled “How to Do a Squat with a Squat Rack,” showing:\n\n1. Set J-cups & safeties → 2) Load bar & collars → 3) Unrack & walkout → 4) Stance & brace → 5) Descend → 6) Bottom position & depth → 7) Drive up → 8) Re-rack, plus a “Common mistakes” box (knees caving, heels lifting, bar drifting forward, excessive arch/round).\n\n# Text steps (detailed)\n\n1. Rack setup\n\n* Set J-cups around mid-chest so the bar is ~1–2 in (2–5 cm) below shoulder height.\n* Set safety pins just below your expected bottom depth (they should catch the bar if you fail without touching it during good reps).\n\n2. Load & secure\n\n* Load plates evenly and add collars. Clear the area behind you.\n\n3. Bar position & grip\n\n* Walk under the bar. Place it across the upper traps (high-bar) or slightly lower on the rear delts (low-bar)—choose one and keep it consistent.\n* Hands just outside shoulder width, squeeze the bar, wrists neutral (not bent back), elbows angled down/back to lock the upper back.\n\n4. Stance & bracing\n\n* Step under the bar with feet under hips, stand tall to unrack.\n* Take 1–2 controlled steps back.\n* Set feet shoulder-width (give or take), toes turned out ~10–30°.\n* Big breath into your belly and sides, brace your core 360°, ribs stacked over pelvis.\n\n5. The descent\n\n* Keep the bar over your mid-foot.\n* Break at hips and knees together; let the knees track over your toes (not collapsing inward).\n* Maintain a neutral spine and steady gaze (chin tucked, eyes forward).\n\n6. Bottom position & depth\n\n* Aim for hip crease at or just below the top of the knee (or the deepest pain-free, controlled range you can maintain).\n* Shins roughly forward, whole foot glued to the floor, weight mid-foot to heel.\n\n7. The ascent\n\n* Drive the floor away, push up through mid-foot/heels.\n* Keep knees tracking over toes and chest tall; think “stand up with the bar” and “drive hips and chest together.”\n* Exhale through the sticking point or finish the rep, then reset your breath between reps.\n\n8. Re-rack safely\n\n* Step forward until both sides touch the uprights, then sit the bar straight down into the J-cups.\n* Don’t let go until you’re sure it’s seated.\n\n9. Safety & spotting tips\n\n* Warm up with the empty bar, then small jumps.\n* Shoes with firm, flat or lifting soles improve stability.\n* Use a spotter for heavy sets (they should follow your torso and assist only if the bar stalls).\n* If you must bail alone: drop to the safeties by sitting back/soft knees and letting the bar settle on the pins—then step forward out.\n\n10. Common mistakes to avoid\n\n* Knees caving in hard.\n* Heels lifting or rocking to toes.\n* Bar drifting forward of mid-foot.\n* Over-arching or rounding the back.\n* Rushing the walkout (take only 1–2 steps).\n\n11. Simple programming starter\n\n* 3–5 sets × 3–8 reps, leaving 1–3 reps in reserve. Rest 2–4 minutes.\n\nWant a version tailored to front squats or low-bar specifics? I can spin up a companion visual/text set.",

    "thinking_trace": "Clarifying image generation process\nI think we need to make the image prompt as detailed as possible: include style, diversity, and annotations. After generating the image, though, the guidelines say we should respond with an empty message, but I also need to include text steps. This feels a little tricky! I'll make sure I follow the instructions carefully.\n\nResolving image and text guidelines\nOkay, the tool’s rule says I shouldn’t summarize the image after generating it. So, I'm debating: Should I send text first and then call the image tool, or is there a way to include both in one response? I’m leaning towards sending the text first and calling the image tool last.\n\nBalancing text and image generation rules\nI want to include both text and the tool call, but I can’t summarize the image afterward. I think I’ll try including the text first, followed by the tool call. The tool says not to summarize the image, but I’m hoping the text steps still comply since they aren’t directly summarizing it.\n\nFinalizing response structure\nI’m wondering whether I can split the response: send the text first, then the image afterward. The user asked for both now, so I’ll need to figure out how to do this. Since every response must include channels, I guess I’ll try to make the image call work as part of the next response.\n\nBalancing user satisfaction and tool rules\nI’m trying to figure out how to provide both text and an image without breaking tool rules. If I send the image first and leave text out, that could fail the user’s request. Maybe sending two messages—one for text, and another for the tool call—would work, but I’m not sure.

    "source": "https://www.wikihow.com/Hold-a-Ping-Pong-Paddle",
    "task_type": "exercise",
    "question_type": "open",
    "text_ref": "1. Fit the blade of the paddle in the space between your thumb and index finger. If you look at your hand you’ll see the “V” shape that your thumb and index finger form. Place the paddle in your hand and move it so that its inside right bottom edge rests in that “V”. 2. Wrap your middle, ring, and pinky fingers around the handle. These are the only fingers you use to hold the ping paddle handle with a shakehand grip. These fingers should look similar to how they look when you’re shaking someone’s hand. Try moving the paddle up and down in a hand-shaking motion to the feel for this grip. 3. Rest your index finger against the outside of the paddle. Again, think of shaking someone’s hand. Your index finger is usually pointed outwards instead of curled in. This will help stabilize the paddle when you swing. If it feels more comfortable, let the tip of your finger rest against the side edge. 4. Curl your thumb around the front of the handle if you want greater wrist flexibility. This is called a shallow shakehand grip, and it's probably the most natural grip for beginners. It’s great for high freedom of movement for the paddle, which will make returning the ball easier. While this grip is usually pretty natural feeling, if it doesn't feel right to you, that may be a sign to try something else. 5. Rest your thumb against the front face of the paddle if you want a firmer grip. While this deep shakehand grip limits wrist flexibility, it works well for precise shots that don’t need a lot of power. Holding your paddle this way will also make it easy to switch the paddle from side to side, so it's great for both forehand and backhand shots. You can always switch between this thumb position and wrapping your thumb around the handle to get the benefits of both! 6. Keep your grip loose. Of course you want to grip the paddle firmly enough so it doesn’t fly out of your hand when you play, but a person should still be able to grab the paddle from you with only slight resistance. A too-tight grip will limit wrist flexibility too much making it difficult to hit or spin the ball. The paddle should feel like a natural extension of your arm, moving as freely as you move your hand. 7. Hold the paddle so its edge is perpendicular to the ground. You’ll notice your wrist tilts slightly downward. While the angle of the paddle will shift as you play, you want your wrist to stay in this position. Avoid floppy wrists when you swing! This will lead to you mis-hitting the ball. You need your entire forearm to swing and if you move your wrists around too much they’ll get tired. 8. Rest the handle in the space between your thumb and index finger. See the “V” shape formed by your thumb and index finger. With the handle angled upwards, rest its edge inside that “V” the way you would a pen. 9. Grip the handle between your thumb and index finger. Form a loop around the handle. Imagine writing with the paddle like a pen or pencil, and try moving it around in a pen writing motion to get a feel for the grip. 10. Keep your remaining fingers relaxed if you want greater wrist flexibility. For the Chinese penhold grip, lightly grip the outside face of the paddle with the tips of your middle, ring, and pinky fingers. Keep your fingers in a relaxed position. Holding the paddle this way will give you a wide range of motion and make it easy to block and push the ball. This grip makes it hard to consistently use backhand topspin or the spinning of the ball using the outside part of the paddle. 11. Straighten your middle, ring, and pinky fingers for more powerful strokes. For the Korean/Japanese penhold grip, the edge of your middle finger should lightly grip the outside face of the paddle with your ring and pinky stacked on top of it. You want your fingers to be rigidly straight. Holding the paddle this way will let you easily return a ball when standing far away from the table. Straight fingers can restrict paddle blade movement, making it harder for you to switch the paddle angle to reach the ball. 12. Use the “V” grip for high power and ball spin. Hold the blade of the paddle between your index and middle finger, forming a “V” shape. Place your thumb where it feels most comfortable. This grip ideal for wide-angle shots. Keep in mind that isn’t as popular as the penhold or shakehand grip, so finding a coach that specializes in it can be hard. 13. Block effectively with the Seemiller grip. Wrap your fingers around the handle of the paddle and rest your index finger on its back face as close to the bottom edge as you can get it. Use your thumb to grip the paddle blade with your index finger from the other side. Since backhand wrist flexibility is limited for this style, you may want to make backhand shots using the forehand side of your paddle. 14. Achieve heavy topspin with the reverse penhold grip. Hold the paddle handle between your thumb and index finger and rest your remaining three fingers against the paddle's outside face, keeping them relaxed. Angle the paddle in your hand slightly up so you can use both sides of the paddle to hit the ball. This grip is very similar to other penhold grips. The difference comes down to the angle you hold paddle and your style of play, and it's not unusual to see this grip combined with the Chinese or Korean/Japanese penhold styles.",

    "GPT_text": "Here are your step-by-step **text instructions** (the visual is provided separately above).\n\n# Shakehand grip (most common)\n\n1. Start neutral\n   Hold the handle like a handshake. Keep your wrist relaxed and the blade (paddle face) roughly vertical.\n\n2. Thumb & index placement\n   Rest your **thumb lightly on the forehand rubber** near the handle. Lay your **index finger across the backhand rubber**, roughly horizontal. They should form a soft “V” along the top of the handle bevel.\n\n3. Wrap the other fingers\n   Curl the remaining three fingers around the handle. Leave a small gap (about a fingertip) between your palm and the handle’s butt—no choking up, no palming the blade.\n\n4. Set pressure points\n   Apply gentle pressure mainly with **thumb and index**. Keep the other fingers loose so the wrist can move freely.\n\n5. Angle for strokes\n   For **forehands**, let the index side relax so the blade can close slightly. For **backhands**, add a touch more pressure with the thumb to open the blade. Adjust in millimeters, not inches.\n\n6. Quick checks\n   Blade makes ~90° with your forearm at rest; wrist feels free; you can wiggle the blade without it slipping.\n\n# Penhold grip (popular in East Asia)\n\n1. Pinch the neck\n   Pinch the front of the blade with **thumb and index** as if holding a pen. The “circle” they form sits just above the handle.\n\n2. Rear-finger support\n   Place the **other three fingers on the back** of the blade. Beginners usually “fan” them; some players “stack” the middle/ring fingers—both are fine.\n\n3. Keep space and softness\n   Leave space between palm and handle. Grip softly so the wrist is very mobile.\n\n4. Forehand feel\n   Most control comes from the thumb–index pinch. Keep the blade slightly closed for drives; open a touch for topspin.\n\n5. Backhand options\n   For traditional penhold, use the forehand side for many shots by rotating the wrist. For RPB (reverse penhold backhand), contact with the back side—keep those rear fingers relaxed to allow the flip.\n\n6. Quick checks\n   No squeezing; blade moves easily with wrist; contact points feel precise at the thumb/index.\n\n# Common mistakes to avoid\n\n* **Death grip** (too tight) → kills wrist speed and touch.\n* **Index finger too high** across the rubber → limits forehand.\n* **Thumb creeping up** onto the rubber → blocks backhand.\n* **Palming the blade** (covering rubber with the palm) → reduces spin and reach.\n\n# Fast reminders\n\n* Relax first, then add just enough firmness at contact.\n* Small pressure shifts (thumb ↔ index) fine-tune forehand/backhand angles.\n* Start with shakehand if you’re unsure; it’s the most versatile for beginners.\n\nIf you want, I can also generate a second image focused solely on **shakehand** or **penhold**, or make printable cue cards.\n",

I think I'll need to generate the images using the tool as instructed, but after generating each one, I'll leave the message empty as requested. For the text steps, I guess I can intersperse them between the image generations!\n\nHandling both images and text\nHmm, so I need to figure out how to provide both images and text in the same response. The instructions say to generate the image, but after that, I can't add text in the same message. I think I could first generate the image, then follow up with text in a separate message. But are multiple messages allowed?\n\nConsidering image response format\nOkay, so the instructions say I must send an empty message right after using the image tool, but I still need to provide text. I wonder if I can call the tool, then follow up with another message with the text? It seems like I can, but it may need a \"final\" message eventually.\n\nFiguring out image generation options\nI'm wondering if I can create multiple images in separate calls first, then send text after.

Maybe I can still send the images in one call, but it might require a separate message for the text.\n\nThought for 1m 16s\n",

Also, I'll include textual descriptions of each step in a separate format. Let's keep it simple with a 2x2 grid image for the visual steps.\n\nBalancing Image and Text Steps\nThe user wants a clean, instructional poster with four panels in a minimalistic vector style. After generating the image, I shouldn’t summarize it, and the tool response will be empty. However, I'll still need to provide the text steps separately to accompany the visual. I'll make sure both are included.\n\nClarifying Image and Text Roles\nOkay, so when I use the image-generation tool, I shouldn't summarize the image in my next message. This means I'll call the image tool and follow that with an empty assistant message, as per guidelines. However, I'll still need to send the text steps separately in another message.\n\nHandling Image and Text in Multiple Messages\nThe guidelines say to send an empty message after generating the image, but I also need to provide the text steps. I can send multiple messages: first the image, then the empty message, and finally a third message with the text steps. This should work, even if the platform prefers one message.\n\nThought for 1m 15s",

    "text_ref": "1. Hold the ball straight out in front of you so that it is at the height of your chest. Drop it and let it bounce. As the ball begins to descend after this bounce, kick it back up into the air. Try to kick it with your dominant foot hard enough that it reaches chest height. Try to kick the ball with your foot angled slightly upward. Make sure to kick the ball with your laces. Make sure that your laces are not double knotted at first. The ball may bounce off of your laces at a weird angle if your laces are tied in a large knot. If you deflate the soccer ball a little bit, you will reduce the intensity of its bounce. The ball will be easier to control and won’t go flying every time you miss a kick. Once you’ve mastered the technique of juggling, you should fully inflate your ball. Keep your ankle 'locked' so that it stays angled and strong. A wobbly ankle leads to a wobbly kick. 2. Keep your knees slightly bent. Doing this will help you have better control over the ball. Do not lock your knees. Keep the foot you are not kicking with (your controlling foot) flat and firmly planted on the ground. It is important to be balanced while juggling the ball. In between touches, it is risky but useful to try to re-balance yourself such that you can maintain control of how you hit the ball each time. Always try to stay balanced on your toes, ready to make quick movements. The biggest key to balancing is to keep your knees bent and your eyes on the ball. 3. Practice until you can easily and consistently catch the ball in front of your stomach. You should not have to lean or reach to catch the ball. Then do the same with your other foot. Keep in mind that juggling with your non-dominant foot will be harder. Keep at it! 4. Increase the number of times you let the ball bounce off your feet. Instead of catching the ball every time you kick it, kick it up into the air and as it falls, kick it up again rather than letting it bounce on the ground. Try to keep the ball under control. Focus on juggling with one foot until you feel confident, then switch to the other foot. Practice until you feel confident juggling with both feet. You can \"catch\" the ball on your foot with careful practice by cushioning the fall of the ball and holding it in place with your foot and shin.",

Eyes up, shoulders relaxed.\n\n2. First touch (“pop”)\n\n* Drop the ball, let it bounce once.\n* Lift your dominant foot; toes slightly up, ankle locked.\n* Strike the bottom-center with your laces so it rises to about waist height.\n\n3. Catch & reset\n\n* After one pop, catch the ball with your hands.\n* Repeat until the touch feels consistent and the ball goes straight up.\n\n4. Two pops, same foot\n\n* Drop → bounce → pop → bounce → pop → catch.\n* Keep touches light, ball close to your body, tiny hop on your standing foot.\n\n5. Alternate feet with a bounce\n\n* Right foot pop, bounce, left foot pop, bounce, catch.\n* Keep the ball centered between your feet.\n\n6. Continuous (no bounce)\n\n* Pop with one foot and, before it drops too far, pop with the other.\n* Aim for knee-to-waist height; stay balanced with small, light hops.\n\n7. Add thighs\n\n* When the ball rises too high for your feet, cushion and lift with your thigh.\n* Keep knees level; hit the mid-thigh so the ball goes straight up.\n\n8. Mix surfaces & control\n\n* Combine feet and thighs in a rhythm (R foot → L foot → R thigh → L foot, etc.).\n* Keep your torso quiet, eyes on the lower half of the ball, ankle locked on every touch.\n\n9. Build consistency (mini goals)\n\n* 5 touches total → 10 → 20 without moving much from your spot.\n* Then try “weak foot only” sets.\n\n10. Quick fixes for common mistakes\n\n* Ball drifting forward: lean slightly over the ball; strike more under the center.\n* Spinning ball: hit with a firm, flat laces surface; avoid toe-poking.\n* Popping too high: relax and hit lighter; aim for consistent knee-to-waist height.\n* Chasing the ball: take smaller hops and keep it centered between your shoulders.\n\nWant a version that adds heading (forehead) or chest control next?",

The process is: first the image, then a separate text message for the steps. I'll make sure the text and image don't overlap. The theme involves creating an illustrated, 8-panel guide with clear steps and labels.\n\nPlanning image and steps\nOkay, the idea is clear: generate the image and text separately. I'll provide the image first, then send a separate message with the 10 steps. I’ll keep the tone casual and helpful, include brief tips, common mistakes, and optional drill progressions. I'll stick to the steps and avoid extra details.\n\nPreparing image and steps\nThe goal is to create a clean, instructional poster with 8 panels and clear labels. I’ll use a neutral gender in the design, incorporate arrows, and set the background possibly to white with bold captions. After generating the image, I'll send the text with steps separately, keeping things concise.\n\nCrafting steps and image prompt\nThe plan is simple: create a clear, instructional poster with 8 panels showing how to juggle a soccer ball. Each step will have a big number and a brief caption. I'll design the character and ball consistently. The focus will be on the actions and positions, keeping it minimal.\n\nThought for 39s\n",

You don't want to fall too far should you lose your balance . 2. Stand straight, with your tailbone tucked in. Engage your core by pulling in your upper ribs and belly. Make sure that the balls of your feet are solidly planted on the edge of the step. Your heels should be over the edge. If you feel unstable, or like you're losing your balance, practice this method with a wall or railing near by. Place your hands on the wall or the railing. 3. Lift your heels until you're standing on your tippy toes. Distribute most of your weight onto the balls of your feet, and keep your legs straight. 4. Stay on your tippy toes for two seconds. Then, begin to lower your heels, and move your weight away from the balls of your feet. Lower your heels until they're below the step, or platform. You should be feeling your calf muscles stretch on the downward movement. Repeat this sequence until you feel tired.",

Setup\n\n* Stand on a sturdy step with the **balls of your feet** on the edge and **heels hanging off**.\n* Feet hip-width, toes pointing straight ahead.\n* Lightly hold a wall/rail for balance. **Soft knees**, chest tall, core braced.\n\n2. Lower (stretch)\n\n* **Slowly** drop your heels below the step until you feel a gentle calf stretch.\n* Keep ankles neutral—don’t let them **roll inward** (no “caving”).\n\n3. Raise (drive up)\n\n* Press through the balls of your feet and lift your heels as **high as possible**.\n* Keep weight over the **big toe and second toe**.\n* **Do not bounce**—move smoothly.\n\n4. Peak squeeze\n\n* At the top, **pause 1 second** and squeeze your calves.\n\n5. Lower with control\n\n* Take **~3 seconds** to lower back to just below step height.\n* Maintain posture and ankle alignment. That’s 1 rep.\n* Suggested tempo: **1 up – 1 hold – 3 down**.\n\nProgramming & tips\n\n* **Sets/Reps:** 3 sets of **8–15** controlled reps.\n* **Breathing:** Exhale up, inhale down.\n* **Range:** Go through your full pain-free range; skip deep stretch if it pinches the Achilles.\n* **Progressions:**\n\n  * Make it harder: do **single-leg** calf raises or hold a dumbbell.\n  * Make it easier: reduce range (stop at step height) or keep both hands on support.\n* **Common mistakes:** bouncing, locking knees, letting ankles cave, turning toes out, leaning forward.\n\nIf you’d like the graphic as a printable PDF or with your gym’s colors/logo, I can generate that too.\n\n",

    "thinking_trace": "\nGenerating calf raise image\nThe user needs both text and visual steps for standing calf raises on a step. Since I can’t use code or web search for the image, I’ll generate it through the designated tool. Once the image is made, I’ll follow with the detailed text instructions, keeping them separate as required.\n\nClarifying message structure\nOkay, the tool response requires me to send an empty message after generating the image—so I can't include text in it. I’ll generate the image first, then I can send the text with instructions as a separate message in an appropriate follow-up. This keeps everything in line with the guidelines.\n\nBreaking down calf raise instructions\nThe plan is to generate a multi-panel image first showing the standing calf raises step-by-step, including front and side views with different positions like neutral, bottom stretch, and top contraction. Then, I’ll send a separate message with the text steps: written instructions, common mistakes, and useful tips—keeping it concise and neutral.\n\nCreating calf raise image\nI’ll create an instructional infographic with a clean, minimal vector style, showing standing calf raises on a step. It’ll feature a clear, gender-neutral figure with visible ankle joints and a large step platform. The image will include 4 panels, presented left to right as requested—simple and effective. Then, I’ll provide text instructions separately.\n\nThought for 22s\n",

For best results, try bending your knees to a 90-degree angle, then standing back up. [1] X Expert Source Dean Theriot Personal Trainer Expert Interview 2. Keep your knees behind your toes. This protects your knees and back and helps you achieve maximum results. When you move into a squat, bend your knees so that they move directly over your feet, without going further than your toes. [3] X Expert Source Dean Theriot Personal Trainer Expert Interview 3. Keep your feet shoulder-width apart. For a standard free squat, start by keeping your feet under your shoulders. This help to avoid stress on your knees. 4. Angle your feet for plié squats. A plié squat is a free squat done with a wide stance. For these, it is important to angle your feet out and to bend your knees so they move directly over your feet. Begin by doing these at only a half-range of motion, and work up to getting your knee bends to 90 degrees. 5. Stop at the bottom. After you build up some leg strength, you may begin to \"break 90,\" or allow your squat to deepen more than a 90-degree bend in your knees. However, it is important to stop when your thighs lightly come into contact with your calves. Going beyond this can place unnecessary stress on your knees.",

    "GPT_text": "# Free (Bodyweight) Squat — Text Guide\n\nFollow these clear, safe steps. If anything hurts (sharp pain), stop and adjust range or seek a pro.\n\n## 1) Set Your Stance\n\n* Feet about shoulder-width apart (a little wider or narrower based on comfort).\n* Toes turned slightly out (≈5–20°) so knees can track over them.\n* Distribute weight through the whole foot (heel + big toe + little toe). Look ahead.\n\n## 2) Brace\n\n* Take a deep breath “360°” into your belly and sides.\n* Gently lock ribs down as if prepping for a cough; keep spine neutral.\n* Set shoulders down/back. Lightly squeeze glutes.\n\n## 3) Initiate: Hips Back, Knees Out\n\n* Start the squat by sending the hips slightly back, then let the knees bend.\n* Let knees track in line with the toes (don’t cave inward).\n* Reach your arms forward a bit for balance if helpful.\n\n## 4) Descend Under Control\n\n* Lower smoothly; keep chest proud and back neutral.\n* Keep heels flat; stay balanced over mid-foot.\n* Go as low as **your** mobility allows—aim for thighs parallel to the floor or lower without losing your brace.\n\n## 5) Check the Bottom Position\n\n* Knees track over toes; don’t collapse inward.\n* Weight balanced (not on toes only; heels stay down).\n* Avoid excessive pelvis tuck (“butt wink”). If it appears, stop just above that range.\n\n## 6) Drive Up\n\n* Push the floor away through mid-foot/heels.\n* Stand up by extending hips and knees together (no shooting hips up first).\n* Keep knees tracking over toes; exhale through the sticking point.\n\n## 7) Finish Tall\n\n* Stand tall with hips and knees fully extended.\n* Reset your breath/bracing before the next rep.\n\n---\n\n## Breathing Cue (Simple)\n\n* **Inhale & brace** before you descend → **exhale** as you drive up.\n* For heavier sets, you can hold a gentle brace until you pass the hardest point, then exhale.\n\n## Common Mistakes → Quick Fixes\n\n* **Heels lift:** Widen stance slightly; slow down; work ankle mobility; try a small heel lift (5–10 mm).\n* **Knees cave in:** Think “spread the floor” or “push knees toward pinky toes.”\n* **Back rounds:** Re-brace; keep chest proud; shorten depth slightly; include core work.\n* **Leaning too far forward:** Bring heels under hips; use counterbalance arms; keep gaze forward.\n* **Bouncing/relaxing at bottom:** Pause briefly; keep tension.\n\n## Regressions (Easier)\n\n* **Box/Chair Squat:** Tap a box/chair behind you for depth control.\n* **Supported Squat:** Hold a doorframe/TRX for assistance.\n* **Heel-elevated Squat:** Place thin plates under heels to ease ankle demand.\n\n## Helpful Progressions (Harder)\n\n* **Goblet Squat (light weight)** for counterbalance and torso position.\n* **Tempo Squat:** 3-sec lower, no bounce, smooth up.\n* **Pause Squat:** 1–2 sec hold at the bottom with tension.\n* **Split Squat / Pistol to Box** for single-leg control.\n\n## Suggested Sets & Reps\n\n* Beginners: **3 × 8–10 reps**, rest 60–90 s.\n* Warm-up: 5 min light cardio + 2–3 easy ramp-up sets.\n\n> Goal: Smooth, controlled reps with consistent depth and balance. Quality first; load later.\n",

    "thinking_trace": "\nReconciling image and text generation\nAlright, the user said to generate the image and text separately, without using code. But, I think they still want the image to be created. Maybe describing the image prompts or giving links would work. I could use two image generation requests — one for an infographic and another for just the text. I should figure out the text steps though.\n\nEvaluating image generation options\nThe user wants the image and text generated separately, without using code, so I need to adjust my approach. They didn’t specifically ask for an actual image file, so they might be fine with descriptions or links. The image generation tool seems necessary, but I’ll need to find a way to provide the text without summarizing the image.\n\nConsidering image generation approach\nThe user didn't specify an actual image file was needed and might be fine with descriptions or links. They did ask for the image to be generated, so I think using the image-generation tool is likely the right choice. I’m wondering if I can send the image first and follow up with text. Maybe two messages could work.\n\nThinking through message logic\nThe rule says not to include text in the message after generating the image, which feels tricky since I also want to send the text separately. I wonder if I can send that text in a follow-up message. Usually, the system expects only one message after a tool call, though… I'll need to confirm this.\n\nExploring alternatives\nThe user asked for both the image and text now, and I can’t postpone or ask further questions. The image-gen tool doesn’t allow text in the same message, making it tricky. Python-generated images aren’t an option either, since the user specifically requested no code. I wonder if ASCII art could be a solution.\n\nExploring method options for text and image generation\nThe challenge is making sure the text and image are separate, while respecting system constraints. Using \"canmore\" for a text document works to keep the text separate, and I'll create a clean image with the image-gen tool. However, the tricky part is making sure the user knows about the text content despite the \"empty message\" requirement afterward.\n\nThought for 1m 23s\n",

Focus on keeping your hips over your heels and relax your pelvis. 2. Jump and press your legs out and arms up. With your feet shoulder-width apart, slightly bend your knees so you can hop. As you jump, open your legs wider than shoulder width and lift your arms overhead. To avoid injury, keep your joints loose. Don’t hold your arms or knees stick-straight; keep them slightly bent. 3. Jump again and land in the starting position. Press up off the floor to hop again. As you do this, bring your arms down and your feet back in beneath your shoulders. You should land in the position you started in. 4. Repeat the jumping motion. The more jumping jacks you do, the more cardio you’ll perform! Keep jumping as a way to warm up before a workout or run, or simply do them for fun to get your heart pumping. Aim to do jumping jacks for 10 to 20 minutes for a cardio exercise. Do jumping jacks for about 5 minutes if you’re warming up for a more intense workout.",

Start (Alignment)\n\n* Stand tall, feet hip-width apart, arms relaxed at your sides.\n* Brace your core, keep chest up, eyes forward, and shoulders down/back.\n\n2. Jump Out\n\n* Inhale gently.\n* Jump feet out to slightly wider than shoulder-width.\n* At the same time, sweep arms out and up to form a wide “V” overhead—elbows straight but not locked, palms facing slightly forward.\n\n3. Return\n\n* Exhale as you jump feet back to hip-width.\n* Bring arms back down to your sides in a controlled arc.\n* Land softly on the balls of your feet; let heels “kiss” the floor.\n\n4. Repeat & Rhythm\n\n* Maintain a steady cadence (e.g., 1–2 out, 1–2 in).\n* Keep torso upright; avoid leaning forward or arching your lower back.\n* Breathe naturally: light inhale out, light exhale in (or vice-versa—just keep it consistent).\n\n# Form tips\n\n* Soft knees: absorb impact; don’t lock them straight.\n* Quiet landings: think “springy” ankles to reduce joint stress.\n* Range of motion: arms to a comfortable overhead V—no shoulder pinching.\n\n# Common mistakes to avoid\n\n* Feet flying too wide (over-striding stresses hips/knees).\n* Bent, flappy arm path; keep a smooth, symmetrical arc.\n* Head craned up or forward; keep neck neutral.\n* Collapsing core or over-arching low back—brace gently.\n\n# Beginner & progression ideas\n\n* Low-impact: step one foot out at a time instead of jumping.\n* Tempo: start with 2–3 sets of 20–30 seconds, rest 30–45 seconds.\n* Progress: increase time, add a light medicine ball overhead (if shoulders tolerate), or try “cross-jack” (cross feet/arms on the in-phase).\n\nIf you want the infographic in a different color scheme, aspect ratio, or with numbered captions baked into each panel, tell me your preferences and I’ll regenerate it.",

    "thinking_trace": "Creating visual and text steps\nThe user wants both visual and text steps for instructions, specifically asking for an image of a person doing jumping jacks with four panels, each numbered and labeled. I'll use a tool to generate the layout with arrows and common mistakes, ensuring clarity. I'll also give text instructions separately to go with it, making sure everything is clear and instructional. Lastly, I'll ensure the image is sized at 1024x1024!\n\nHandling the image and text requirements\nIt looks like the tool requires an empty response after generating the image, which conflicts with the need to send both the image and text. I think the best option might be to send the image first, then follow with a separate message containing the text steps, assuming multiple messages are allowed.\n\nPlanning response sequence\nThe challenge here seems to be how to handle the image generation and text steps, given that the system requires an empty response after generating the image. My plan is to first generate the image (with an empty message following it), then send the text steps in a second message. Hopefully, the system accepts consecutive responses!\n\nManaging image and text delivery\nIt looks like the best option is to follow the tool guidelines and generate the image first with an empty response, then send a separate message with the text steps. This seems in line with how other solutions have handled similar tasks, even though the system typically allows only one final message.\n\nThought for 15s\nDone",

Practice approaching the basket slowly at first, and increase your speed once you've got the footwork down. You can do a right-handed layup if you're starting near the center or right side of the basket. If you're approaching the basket from the left, you'll want to do a left-handed layup. 2.

Use this step to gain distance and position yourself within easy shooting range. Dribble the ball one last time just outside your right foot. 3. Jump off of your left foot. As soon as your left foot lands, use it to jump in the direction of the basket. Your body should be moving toward the basket, but don't lean forward. Ideally, you'll be positioned close enough to the basket that you can jump straight up to take your shot. As you jump, bring the ball out of the dribble to your chest to prepare for the shot. 4. Shoot with your right arm as you lift your right leg. As you jump, imagine a string attached to your right arm and your right leg. Move them at the same time as you shoot, as though someone were pulling upward on the string. Your right knee should be bent and pointed toward the basket while your right arm moves up to shoot the ball. Arch your arm toward the basket. Shoot with your elbow slightly bent, so that your arm looks like the neck of a swan. When you're doing a layup, the shooting technique is slightly different from that of a regular shot. Instead of using your left hand to steady the ball, you want to shoot the ball using only your right hand. This gives you more reach, and since you're so close to the basket that it's difficult to miss the shot, you don't really need your left hand to steady the ball. As you shoot, slightly rotate your wrist inward to give the ball a little bit of spin, rather than snapping your wrist forward as you would for a regular shot. The gentle spin will keep it from hammering off the rim or backboard with too much force. 5. Aim for the sweet spot on the backboard. One of the reasons a layup is such a sure bet is because you can always use the backboard to help ease the shot into the basket. When you're doing a right-handed layup, the sweet spot is slightly above the top right corner of the small square in the center of the backboard. This spot absorbs the impact of the ball and drops it right down through the net. You'll get two points no matter how you make your shot, but it's better to aim for the backboard instead of trying to just tip the ball over the rim. The backboard allows more room for error, but if you hit the rim funny the ball will bounce right out. There's nothing worse than missing a wide-open layup when you have full access to the basket, so work on hitting that sweet spot every time. 6. Practice until your muscles remember the movement. The layup is a fundamental basketball move that will become second nature after you practice it enough. You should get to the point where your body remembers what to do and you don't have to think about which foot to put forward and which one to jump off: you just do it. Do layups as part of every basketball practice . As you practice, you'll start to get a good sense for how fast to approach the basket and from what distance to begin your layup footwork and launch into a jump. Work on doing layups while you're being defended or off of a long pass.",

    "thinking_trace": "Planning layup steps\nI'm planning to create a visual breakdown of the footwork and layup steps for a right-handed layup from the right side. This will include instructions and visual steps, like 6-8 panels with minimal text. I'll also include a left-hand variation and ensure clarity on ball position, foot placement, and other key details.\n\nClarifying layup footwork\nFor a right-handed layup from the right side, the footwork is: dribble with the right hand, step with right foot, step with left foot (ball pickup), then jump off the left foot while shooting with the right hand. The sequence is smooth: right-left for right layups, left-right for left layups.\n\nDescribing layup steps\nFor a right-handed layup: after the right-left steps, pick up the ball with the right hand on the left foot step, then jump off the left foot. Focus on driving the right knee up, extending the right arm, and aiming for the top corner of the small backboard square. Follow through and land. Visual step-by-step in a clean, 8-panel design.\n\nVisualizing the layup\nI'll show a player in a simple uniform, step-by-step: starting the dribble, gathering the ball, and finishing the layup. I’ll add callouts for footwork (right-left), jumping off the left foot, using the backboard, and protecting the ball with the off-hand. There's also a mini inset for the left-hand layup. I'll keep the text minimal and straightforward. The background will be simple, supporting the focus on essential actions.\n\nThought for 1m 4s\n",

Once you have completed one set of crunches on one side of your body (about 10–15 reps), turn your legs over to do the crunches on other side of your body. It’s recommended to do this exercise 1–3 sets on each side, 2–3 times a week.",

Set up\n\n* Lie on your **right side** on a mat.\n* Bend knees about **90°** and stack hips, knees, and ankles.\n* Right forearm on the floor for balance; **left hand** lightly behind your head (don’t pull your neck).\n* Keep ribs “down” and neck neutral.\n\n2. Brace\n\n* Take a breath in.\n* Gently **brace your core** as if preparing for a light poke, keeping hips stacked and elbow open.\n\n3. Crunch up\n\n* **Exhale** and bring your **left ribcage toward your left hip**.\n* Lift both shoulders a few inches; keep elbow wide and gaze forward.\n* Knees and legs stay quiet—movement comes from your **obliques**, not from tugging the head.\n\n4. Pause\n\n* Hold the top position for **1 second**, keep breathing softly, feel the side squeeze.\n\n5. Lower with control\n\n* **Inhale** and lower your shoulders back to the start without collapsing. Maintain tension.\n\n6. Repeat & switch sides\n\n* Do **8–15 controlled reps**, then **flip to your left side** to work the right obliques.\n* Aim for **2–3 sets per side**.\n\n### Form tips & common mistakes\n\n* Keep hips stacked; don’t roll backward.\n* Don’t yank on your head—your hand just supports.\n* Small range is fine; prioritize **slow, controlled** reps.\n* If you feel your neck more than your side, reduce range and press your tongue lightly to the roof of your mouth to help stabilize.\n\n### Make it easier\n\n* Place top hand across your chest instead of behind your head.\n* Keep bottom arm straight and use it lightly on the floor for balance.\n\n### Make it harder\n\n* Straighten your legs and keep feet slightly off the floor.\n* Add a light dumbbell or small plate held against the side of your ribcage (still no neck pulling).\n\nIf you want variations (e.g., **side plank crunch** or **standing side crunch**), say the word and I’ll add those too.\n",

    "thinking_trace": "\nProviding side crunch instruction\nOkay, we won't be using web search; they're asking for general fitness and side crunches. I'll offer exercise instructions including safety tips and common mistakes to avoid. For the side crunch, I'll describe the side-lying oblique crunch, providing detailed steps. Visual cues and reps will also be included.\n\nCreating exercise visual guide\nI’ll create a clear, step-by-step guide to the side crunch (side-lying oblique crunch) composed of six panels, showing each part of the movement: start, brace, crunch, pause, lower, and repeat the other side. I'll include instructions for maintaining proper body alignment and keep it simple, safe, and without medical claims.\n\nPreparing instructions and visuals\nI’ll first create a clear 6-panel image showing the side crunch, labeled from 1 to 6, with a gender-neutral figure performing the exercise on a mat. Afterward, I’ll write a step-by-step guide with numbered bullets, highlighting common mistakes, progressions, and reps. The text will be separate and friendly!\n\nOutlining side crunch panels\nThe visual guide will include minimal grey outline figures with blue highlights for the obliques (if allowed), but I won't specify colors—it's about keeping it simple. Panel 1: start with knees bent and body aligned; Panel 2: brace by stacking ribs and pelvis; Panel 3: crunch by driving the ribs toward the hip and lifting the shoulders.\n\nThought for 36s\n",

    "text_ref": "1. Get the right glove. Your glove becomes an extension of your hand when catching a baseball. It must fit your hand properly to work efficiently. As a general rule of thumb, players under the age of 12 will use a glove in the 10–11 inch (25.4–27.9 cm) range. Older players will use something between 11 and 13 inch glove. Before playing regularly with your glove, it’s important to beak in your glove. One of the best ways to break in your glove is by practicing your catch. [1] X Expert Source Isaac Hess Baseball Coach & Instructor Expert Interview 2. Position your body. Catching a baseball relies heavily on your stance and body position. You should be in the athletic position to prepare catching a ball. The athletic position takes the following into effect: Bend your knees slightly. This will give you the flexibility to lung for the ball and keep your mind focused. Keep your shoulders positioned towards the target. This will make it easier to visualize and react once the ball comes towards you. Stand on the balls of your feet instead of standing flat-footed. 3. Watch the ball. The key to catching a baseball is to never let the ball out of your sight. Keep your eyes fixed from the time the ball leaves the thrower's hand until it lands in your glove. By watching the ball, you can track the ball’s flight plan, and prepare for the right stance to catch the ball. ”You can’t catch what you can’t see,” meaning it'll be difficult to catch the ball if your eye is off the ball. 4. Go to the ball. Don’t feel inclined to stay anchored in one place, but instead move to catch the ball. If the ball is thrown and you can tell it will land behind you, run backwards while watching the ball. In baseball, catchers play by zone defense. When the ball enters your zone, it’s your job to move to it. 5. Position your glove. Hold your glove with your palm facing outwards in front of your body. Position the glove in the direction of the target who is throwing the ball. If the ball is thrown above your belly button, you can use this stance to catch the ball with little adjustment. If the throw is below your belly button, rotate your glove so that your fingers are pointed down. When the ball is thrown above your body, use the first position mentioned, but extend your arm upwards. 6. Catch the baseball. Catch the ball in the pocket of the glove. The pocket is another name for the palm of the glove. Close your hand immediately once the ball makes contact with your glove. Get into the practice of using your second hand to secure the catch. Using your second hand will also prepare you to throw once you become a catcher. Your free hand needs to have quick access to the ball. 7. Keep your vision clear. Be careful not to obstruct your vision with your glove when going for the catch. If a ball is heading towards your face, move your glove to the position at the last second. This might take some practice, but the goal is to watch the ball till the final second. Practice throwing with a friend to avoid a black eye on game day. You can usually reposition yourself to avoid your face crossing the ball’s flight path.",

    "GPT_text": "Here are the **text steps** (separate from the image):\n\n1. Ready stance\n   • Feet a little wider than shoulders, knees bent.\n   • Glove open in front of your chest; throwing hand just above/behind the glove. Eyes on the ball.\n\n2. Read & move\n   • Track the ball early. Take short, quick steps to get **behind** it so it comes to you—not you to it.\n\n3. Present the glove\n   • **Fly balls/pop-ups:** glove **fingers up**, pocket to the ball at about eye level or slightly above your head.\n   • **Grounders:** get low; glove **fingers down** with the heel near the ground, body square to the ball.\n\n4. Soften the catch (“give”)\n   • Let the glove travel a bit with the ball’s momentum. Don’t stab.\n\n5. Use two hands\n   • As the ball hits the pocket, cover it with your throwing hand immediately.\n\n6. Funnel to your chest\n   • Bring the glove to the center of your body to secure it and prepare a throw or tag.\n\n7. Communicate & position\n   • For fly balls say “Mine!” and take priority if you have the easier angle. Avoid backpedaling—turn and run to the spot, then get set.\n\n8. Bare-hand (only on soft tosses/foul balls in the stands)\n   • Keep fingers together, elbows slightly bent, and **give** with the ball. Avoid trying to bare-hand hard line drives.\n\n9. Common cues\n   • “Fingers up for sky; fingers down for ground.”\n   • “Move your feet, not just your glove.”\n   • “Two hands; funnel to chest.”\n\n10. Quick practice drill\n    • Toss yourself short pop-ups and grounders, focusing on glove angle and soft hands; progress to partner throws from different angles.\n\n---\n\nI also created a **visual step-by-step image** (separate from the text) showing ready stance, moving under a fly ball (fingers up), and fielding a grounder (fingers down) with two-hand secure and funnel to chest.\n",

    "thinking_trace": "\nConsidering image and text separation\nThe user wants the image and text to be generated separately, which makes sense. I’m thinking about how I can manage this. Maybe I could generate the image first, and then add the text afterwards in a separate message? I can’t embed both together seamlessly, but I might be able to use two steps for this task.\n\nNavigating image and text separation\nThe user requested text and image separately, but after generating the image with the tool, I can’t send text in the same message due to the tool’s restrictions. Using a work-around like ASCII art might not hit the mark since it still counts as “image.” Looks like my options are limited for now.\n\nResolving image and text order\nThe user specifically requested not to use code to generate the image, but didn’t rule out using the image tool. So, I can generate it that way. However, they also want text steps. Hmm, I think it’s best to generate the image first, then send the text separately, though this must be done in distinct messages.\n\nWorking through image and text delivery\nThe platform sometimes allows a tool message followed by an assistant message with text. But the tool says after the call to send an empty message. I’m considering sending the text steps first, then generating the image—however, the challenge is reconciling the instructions and ensuring the tool's limitations are followed.\n\nBalancing image and text requirements\nThe user wants images and text generated separately, but the tool’s \"empty message\" rule after creating an image complicates things. I’m thinking of providing the text steps first, then generating the image in a separate message. While risky, this should satisfy the user's request while adhering to the tool's limitations.\n\nClarifying visual and text step process\nI need to find a way to balance the user's request for both image and text steps. A clean approach: Provide numbered text steps first, ensuring clarity and safety. Then, I’ll generate an infographic with step labels. The key challenge is not violating the “empty message” rule while delivering both content elements.\n\nCreating step-by-step instructions and visual content\nAlright, the user wants clear visual steps and text steps separately. I’ll create a 6-panel infographic to showcase fly ball and ground ball catching, with minimal labels. For the text, I’ll provide concise, easy-to-follow steps and include basic safety tips. I’ll keep it focused and provide all necessary details without overwhelming the user.\n\nThought for 1m 41s\n",

Please generate: 1. A visual diagram showing how these components interact. 2. A separate caption summarizing the key idea of the figure. Please provide the image and caption separately.",

Together, LAPE and STP enable efficient video compression and precise spatio-temporal localization. The model is trained with the large-scale ST-Align dataset (4.3M samples), covering diverse tasks such as Spatial-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG), Event Localization and Captioning (ELC), and Spatial Video Grounding (SVG).

The outputs are high-quality CoTs paired with annotations and confidence scores, forming an enhanced dataset. This enriched dataset can then be used to fine-tune VLMs for interpretable and accurate reasoning in complex image annotation tasks. Please generate: 1.

When tectonic forces push, pull, or shear the crust, stress builds along the fault.\n\nHow faults cause earthquakes (the stick-slip cycle):\n1.\tLocked: Rough fault surfaces “stick” due to friction while plate motion keeps stressing them.\n2.\tStrain builds: Rock around the fault elastically bends and stores energy.\n3.\tRupture: When stress exceeds frictional strength, the fault suddenly slips. The break starts at the hypocenter (focus) at depth and spreads along the fault.\n4.\tSeismic waves: Stored elastic energy radiates as P and S waves that shake the ground. The point on the surface above the focus is the epicenter.\n5.\tAftershocks: The crust adjusts to the new positions, producing smaller quakes on or near the same fault.\n\nMain fault types & the stresses that create them:\n•\tNormal fault (tension/extension): Crust is pulled apart; the hanging wall moves down.\n•\tReverse/thrust fault (compression): Crust is squeezed; the hanging wall moves up (common in subduction zones and mountain belts).\n•\tStrike-slip fault (shear): Blocks slide horizontally past each other (e.g., transform boundaries); motion can be right-lateral or left-lateral.\n\nWhy some places shake more:\nMost large earthquakes occur at plate boundaries where stress accumulates fastest: subduction zones (big thrust quakes), continental collisions (reverse faults), and major transforms (strike-slip).\n\nImage generated separately above: labeled diagram showing a fault plane, the earthquake cycle with hypocenter/epicenter and waves, plus normal/reverse/strike-slip fault insets.",

All three rays should meet at the same point. The Principal Ray or Chief Ray in an optical system is the meridional ray that starts at the edge of the object and passes through the center of the aperture stop. This ray crosses the optical axis at the locations of the pupils. The Central Ray is perpendicular to infrared radiation.

In geometric optics we treat light as straight-line rays that are perpendicular to wavefronts and that obey the rules of **reflection** (angle in = angle out) and **refraction** (Snell’s law) at boundaries.\n\n**Main types of rays you see in ray diagrams**\n\n1. **Incident ray** – the incoming ray that strikes a surface or boundary.\n2. **Reflected ray** – the ray that bounces off a mirror; its angle to the normal equals the incident angle.\n3. **Refracted (transmitted) ray** – the ray that passes into a new medium and bends according to Snell’s law.\n4. **Principal rays** – standard, easy-to-trace rays used to locate images with thin lenses and spherical mirrors:\n\n* **For thin lenses**\n\n  * **Parallel (P) ray:** parallel to the principal axis; after the lens it passes through the focal point (F) (converging lens) or appears to come from (F) (diverging lens).\n  * **Focal (F) ray:** aimed toward the focal point before the lens; emerges parallel to the axis (roles swap for diverging lenses).\n  * **Central/Chief (O) ray:** passes through the optical center and continues essentially undeviated.\n\n* **For spherical mirrors**\n\n  * **Parallel (P) ray:** parallel to the axis; reflects through (F) (concave) or appears to come from (F) behind the mirror (convex).\n  * **Focal (F) ray:** goes through (F); reflects parallel to the axis.\n  * **Center-of-curvature (C) ray:** goes through the center of curvature; reflects back on itself.\n\nIn diagrams, **solid lines** usually show real rays; **dashed extensions** show virtual rays that appear to originate from a point.\n\n---\n\n# Image\n\nI’ve generated a labeled teaching diagram that shows:\n\n* Principal rays for a **converging lens**, **diverging lens**, **concave mirror**, and **convex mirror** (with objects and images).\n* Small insets for **reflection at a plane mirror** and **refraction at a boundary** with angles labeled.\n\nIf you’d like any changes—different colors, thicker lines, or additional cases (e.g., object between (F) and the lens)—say the word and I’ll regenerate it.\n",

I’ll go ahead and create the image description for rays in ray diagrams, like principal rays for lenses.\n\nA ray in optics is a straight-line representation of light's path. For thin lenses:\n\nA ray parallel to the axis refracts through the focal point (convex lens) or diverges from it (concave lens).\n\nRays passing through focal points either emerge parallel or continue straight.\nFor mirrors, similar principles apply.\n\nAn optical ray is a line that shows the direction of light propagation. Common types are the incident, reflected, and refracted rays. For lenses and mirrors, we focus on principal rays like parallel, focal, and optical center rays. In optics, we also discuss emergent and virtual rays.\n\nThe idea is to create an educational diagram with labeled rays for both lenses and mirrors. There will be panels for converging and diverging lenses, as well as concave and convex mirrors. Each ray will be labeled (e.g., parallel-to-axis, incident/refracted), and the diagram will have a clear, white background.",

Because of their molecular vibration modes, they interact strongly with the wavelengths of heat the surface gives off after being warmed by sunlight.\n\n**Main greenhouse gases:**\n\n* **Water vapor (H₂O)** — most abundant, highly variable\n* **Carbon dioxide (CO₂)**\n* **Methane (CH₄)**\n* **Nitrous oxide (N₂O)**\n* **Ozone (O₃)**\n* **Halocarbons** (e.g., CFCs, HFCs) in small amounts\n\n(For contrast: **nitrogen (N₂)**, **oxygen (O₂)**, and **argon (Ar)** make up most of the air but are *not* effective greenhouse gases because they don’t absorb infrared efficiently.)\n\n# Why the greenhouse effect matters for life\n\n1. **Sunlight (shortwave)** passes through the atmosphere; some is reflected by clouds and bright surfaces like ice.\n2. **Earth’s surface absorbs** the rest and **re-emits** energy upward as **infrared (longwave)** heat.\n3. **Greenhouse gases absorb and re-emit** some of that heat in all directions, including back toward the surface.\n4. This slows the escape of heat to space and **warms the lower atmosphere and surface** until a balance is reached between incoming sunlight and outgoing infrared.\n\n**Without the natural greenhouse effect,** Earth’s average surface temperature would be about **−18 °C (0 °F)**.\n**With it,** the average is about **+15 °C (59 °F)** — warm enough for **liquid water, stable climates, and the ecosystems and agriculture** life depends on.\n\n> Note: Adding extra greenhouse gases (e.g., rising CO₂ and CH₄) **enhances** the effect, shifting the balance and driving **modern climate change**.\n\n---\n\n**Image:** A labeled infographic illustrating the steps above (Sunlight in, reflection, surface warming, infrared out, greenhouse gases re-emitting heat, and the −18 °C vs +15 °C note).",

They explicitly want no code or web search; I'll use a diagram to illustrate the greenhouse effect. After I generate the image, I'll respond without summarizing it—just following the instructions!\n\nThe challenge is that the system clears my message when I use the image generation tool. I need to send two separate messages: one with text, then one invoking the tool, but with no further content in my second message. After I generate the image, I can't summarize it, so that’s where things get tricky.\n\nThe instruction is tricky—the system wants me to send an empty message after generating an image. So I should send the explanation text first, followed by the tool call. Once the image is generated, I'll leave the second message intentionally blank, like instructed. The platform allows multiple messages, so this works.\n\nThe first step is to send the explanation text about the greenhouse effect and gases separately. I'll describe the process and gases (water vapor, CO2, methane, etc.), and avoid numbers in the image, since uploading code or web searches isn't allowed. The second step is just generating the image with arrows and labels as instructed. Simple and clear!\n\nI need to deliver both text and image separately, but the system's restriction requires an empty response after the image is generated. The solution is to send text in one message first, then generate the image in a separate step, and ensure there's no comment about the image afterward.\n\nThe tool requires an empty message after the image is generated, but the user asks for both text and an image. To meet the requirement, the strategy is to first provide the text in one message, then send the image in the next message, ensuring the text isn't described in the image message, so the final remains empty.\n\nI want to satisfy the user's request for both text and an image, though the tool says I should send no text after generating the image. I’ll provide the text in the final message and follow it with the image generation tool in a separate message. It’s a bit of a workaround, but I think it’s the best option.",

Above that, lighter gases become more common (start of the **heterosphere**).\n* **Ionosphere:** Not a separate “layer” by altitude alone; it **overlaps** the mesosphere/thermosphere (\\~60–1,000 km) and is defined by ionization from solar radiation (important for auroras and radio).\n\nIf you’d like, I can add typical Celsius/°F scale values on the temperature curve or include example altitudes for planes, balloons, meteors, the ISS, and GPS satellites.\n",

Its energy is **below** the top of the barrier, yet it can still escape by *tunneling* (inset potential curve).\n\n3. **Transformation (notation).**\n   [\n   ^A_Z X ;\\rightarrow; ^{A-4}_{Z-2} Y ;+; ^4_2\\mathrm{He} ;+; Q\n   ]\n\n   * **Mass number (A)** drops by 4.\n   * **Atomic number (Z)** drops by 2 (element changes).\n   * (Q) is the released energy from the small mass difference.\n\n4. **Energy and momentum sharing.**\n   The (Q)-value appears mainly as the **kinetic energy of the alpha**, with a smaller **recoil** of the daughter nucleus; momenta are equal and opposite.\n\n5. **Takeaway.**\n   Alpha decay reduces a heavy nucleus to a slightly lighter one, emitting a helium-4 nucleus and energy; the escape happens via **quantum tunneling**, not by climbing over the barrier.\n\nIf you’d like, I can generate a second version of the diagram with a specific real example (e.g., (^{238}\\mathrm{U}\\rightarrow{}^{234}\\mathrm{Th}+\\alpha)) and labeled numbers that match these steps exactly.",

An example with U-238 -> Th-234 + alpha will be included.\n\nI'll include typical energies (4-9 MeV) and velocities (15,000 km/s), but since they're not strictly necessary, I'll skip them for now. The user requested a diagram, so I’ll map labels (1...6) in the explanation, referencing the image. The image will have a high-contrast multi-panel vector style, with labels and an energy barrier inset. I'll avoid transparent backgrounds and set the size to 1024x1024 for clarity.\n\nFor the alpha decay diagram, the left side will feature the parent nucleus (like U-238) with protons in red and neutrons in blue. I'll highlight the alpha cluster (2 protons, 2 neutrons) inside. There will be an arrow showing quantum tunneling through the potential barrier. The right side will show the daughter nucleus (like Th-234) and the emitted alpha particle moving in opposite directions, with an equation at the center.\n\nFor the diagram, I’ll add callouts, like showing the α cluster forming inside the nucleus (2 protons, 2 neutrons), demonstrating tunneling through the Coulomb barrier, and noting the conservation of mass number and atomic number (A decreases by 4, Z by 2).

    "GPT_text": "# Image — Full Carbon Cycle\n\n*(See the generated diagram above.)*\n\n# Explanation — How carbon moves, and how plant carbon ends up in fossil fuels or the air\n\n**Big picture:** Carbon moves through two intertwined loops.\n\n* The **fast (biological) cycle** shuttles carbon among the atmosphere, living things, soils, and the upper ocean (timescales: days to centuries).\n* The **slow (geologic) cycle** locks carbon into rocks and fossil fuels and returns it via tectonics and volcanoes (millennia to millions of years).\n  Human activities overlay both, rapidly moving long-stored carbon back to the air.\n\n## 1) Atmosphere ↔ Land (plants, animals, soils)\n\n1. **Photosynthesis (atmosphere → plants):** Plants take in CO₂ and build sugars/biomass.\n2. **Respiration (plants & animals → atmosphere):** Almost everything that burns those sugars releases CO₂ back.\n3. **Herbivory & food webs:** Plant carbon moves to animals; their respiration returns CO₂.\n4. **Death & detritus (plants/animals → soils):** Litter and carcasses enter soils.\n5. **Decomposition:**\n\n   * **With oxygen (oxic):** Microbes break biomass down, releasing **CO₂**.\n   * **Low-oxygen/anaerobic (wetlands, bogs, sediments):** Microbes produce **CH₄ (methane)**, which later oxidizes in the air to CO₂.\n6. **Fire:** Wildfires rapidly convert biomass to CO₂ (and some CH₄/black carbon); regrowth can re-absorb CO₂ over years to decades.\n7. **Soil storage:** Some carbon becomes stable **soil organic matter** (humus), persisting from years to centuries unless disturbed (e.g., tillage, warming, drought).\n\n## 2) Atmosphere ↔ Ocean\n\n1. **Gas exchange:** CO₂ dissolves into and out of the **surface ocean** depending on temperature, winds, and concentration gradients.\n2. **Carbonate chemistry:** In seawater, CO₂ forms **carbonic acid ↔ bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) ↔ carbonate (CO₃²⁻)**. Most ocean carbon is stored as bicarbonate/carbonate, buffering the atmosphere.\n3. **Biological pump:** Phytoplankton photosynthesize; part of their organic matter and the **CaCO₃ shells** from calcifying organisms sink, carrying carbon to the **deep ocean**. Much is respired at depth (CO₂ stored for decades–centuries) and later **upwells** back to the surface and air.\n\n## 3) Route from plant carbon → **fossil fuels** (slow cycle)\n\nOnly a tiny fraction of plant carbon escapes decomposition and fire:\n\n1. **Rapid burial in anoxic settings:** In swamps, peatlands, deltas, or marine muds, dead plant/algal matter is buried faster than it decays. Low oxygen slows microbes.\n2. **Diagenesis & maturation (heat + pressure + time):**\n\n   * **Terrestrial plants → peat → lignite → coal.**\n   * **Marine algae/zooplankton → organic-rich muds → kerogen → oil & natural gas.**\n3. **Geologic storage:** These hydrocarbons remain trapped in rocks for millions of years unless exposed, uplifted, or extracted.\n\n## 4) Weathering, rocks, and volcanoes (slow geologic loop)\n\n1. **Silicate weathering (atmosphere → rivers → ocean):** CO₂ in rainwater forms weak acid that weathers rocks; dissolved bicarbonate flows to the ocean.\n2. **Carbonate formation:** Marine organisms and chemistry turn bicarbonate into **limestone/dolomite (CaCO₃/MgCO₃)** that gets buried as rock.\n3. **Subduction & degassing:** Tectonics carry carbonates and organic sediments into the mantle; **volcanoes** and metamorphism return CO₂ to the atmosphere.\n\n## 5) Human accelerators\n\n* **Fossil fuel extraction & combustion → atmosphere:** Moves carbon from the slow reservoir (coal/oil/gas) to the fast one as CO₂.\n* **Cement production:** Releases CO₂ when limestone is calcined.\n* **Deforestation & land-use change:** Reduces photosynthetic uptake and releases stored biomass/soil carbon.\n* **Methane leaks & agriculture:** Add CH₄, which later becomes CO₂.\n* **Permafrost thaw/peatland drainage:** Frees long-stored organic carbon as CO₂/CH₄.\n* **Ocean uptake & acidification:** Extra atmospheric CO₂ drives more dissolution, shifting seawater chemistry and affecting calcifiers.\n\n## 6) Direct answers to your two “where does plant carbon go?” questions\n\n* **Into the atmosphere:** through plant/animal **respiration**, **microbial decay** (CO₂/CH₄), **fires**, and **human burning** of biomass or extracted fossil fuels.\n* **Into fossil fuels:** when dead plant (or algal) material is **rapidly buried in oxygen-poor sediments**, then **cooked by heat and pressure** for **geologic timescales**, transforming into **coal (mainly land plants)** or **oil/gas (mainly marine algae/zooplankton)**.\n\nIf you’d like, I can tailor a simpler “student cheat-sheet” version or add typical timescales and example environments for each arrow.\n",

Starting with atmospheric CO2, it gets absorbed by plants through photosynthesis, enters the biomass, and then cycles through respiration, consumption by animals, etc. Eventually, fossil fuels form, and weathering processes regulate CO2.\n\nExplaining the carbon cycle\nIn the oceanic cycle, CO2 exchanges at the surface, phytoplankton photosynthesize, and through the biological pump, CO2 is stored in the deep oceans. The anthropogenic cycle involves fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, and other factors that increase atmospheric CO2. I should group this into an \"Image\" for clarity, showing labeled arrows.\n\nPreparing carbon cycle explanation\nFor the diagram, I’ll use color-coded arrows to represent fast versus slow fluxes, annotating time scales and key processes. Since the user didn’t ask for flux numbers, I won’t include them, focusing on a conceptual diagram instead. I’ll present the image and explanation separately with clear labels like “# Image” and “# Explanation.”\n\nExplaining plant carbon pathways\nI'll outline the steps showing how plant carbon ends up in fossil fuels. Some plant biomass escapes decomposition, gets buried in anoxic sediments, and over millions of years becomes peat, then coal or oil/gas. I'll note the conditions of rapid burial, low oxygen, and high pressure. I’ll keep methane details general.\n\nThought for 39s\nDone",

The trachea, also called the windpipe, filters the air that is inhaled, according to the American Lung Association. It branches into the bronchi, which are two tubes that carry air into each lung. The bronchial tubes are lined with tiny hairs called cilia. Cilia move back and forth, carrying mucus up and out.

This is the **mucociliary escalator**.\n\n**3) What happens to the trapped stuff.**\n\n* When the mucus reaches the throat, you **swallow** it. Stomach acid and enzymes break down most contaminants.\n* If there’s a lot of irritation, sensors trigger a **cough or sneeze**, which blasts mucus and particles out.\n\n**4) Deep areas without cilia: the alveoli.**\n\n* The tiny air sacs (alveoli) handle gas exchange and **don’t have cilia**.\n* Here, roaming **alveolar macrophages** (patrolling immune cells) **eat** fine particles and microbes.\n* What they collect is carried away via the mucociliary escalator (after they crawl to ciliated regions) or through **lymphatic drainage**.\n\n**5) Size matters (where particles tend to land).**\n\n* **Large** (> ~10 μm): mostly stopped in the **nose/throat**.\n* **Medium** (~2.5–10 μm): settle in the **trachea/bronchi**, cleared by cilia.\n* **Fine** (< ~2.5 μm): can reach the **alveoli**, handled by macrophages.\n* **Gases/ultrafine** may be absorbed or exhaled.\n\n**6) When the system struggles.**\n\n* **Dry air, dehydration, smoking, or pollutants** can thicken or paralyze mucus/cilia.\n* Certain conditions (e.g., **asthma**, **chronic bronchitis**, **cystic fibrosis**, or **primary ciliary dyskinesia**) reduce clearance, so particles linger and infections are more likely.\n\n**Quick recap:** your airways trap particles in mucus, **cilia sweep** that mucus upward, and **cough/sneeze or swallowing** removes it; deep in the lungs, **macrophages** finish the cleanup.\n\nIf you’d like, I can add labels or callouts to the diagram tailored to a specific class level (middle school vs. college).\n",

Light from the **illuminator** is focused through the specimen by the **condenser**. The **objective** forms a **real, inverted intermediate image** inside the tube; the **eyepiece** then magnifies that into the **virtual image** you see.\n\n**Total magnification = (eyepiece power) × (objective power).**\n**Resolution** (smallest detail you can separate) improves with higher **NA** of the objective/condenser and with shorter wavelengths of light.\n\n## What each numbered part does (match to the image)\n\n1. **Eyepiece (ocular)** – Magnifies the intermediate image made by the objective; often 10×. Some models include a **diopter** ring to match focus between your eyes.\n\n2. **Head / Body tube** – Holds the optics at fixed spacing so the objective image forms at the correct plane for the eyepiece.\n\n3. **Revolving nosepiece (turret)** – Clicks different **objective lenses** into the light path quickly.\n\n4. **Objectives (4×, 10×, 40×, 100× oil)** – The primary magnifiers; also the main drivers of **resolution** and **working distance**.\n\n   * **4× (scanning):** wide field, easy to find the specimen.\n   * **10× (low):** more detail, still forgiving.\n   * **40× (high dry):** fine detail; use **fine focus only**.\n   * **100× oil:** highest detail; requires immersion oil to boost NA and resolution.\n\n5. **Stage** – Platform that holds the slide. Often a **mechanical stage** with **X–Y controls** for precise movement.\n\n6. **Slide & stage clips** – Secure the specimen directly over the light path.\n\n7. **Coarse focus knob** – Moves the stage quickly to find focus at low power.\n\n8. **Fine focus knob** – Small, precise motion for sharp focus, especially at 40×/100×.\n\n9. **Condenser** – A lens system that concentrates light onto the specimen; usually raised close to the underside of the slide for brightfield.\n\n10. **Iris diaphragm (substage)** – Adjustable aperture beneath the condenser. **Open** for brightness and resolution; **close** for more contrast (but less resolution). Use together with the condenser height.\n\n11. **Field diaphragm (if present)** – Controls the illuminated field size; helps set Köhler illumination and reduce stray light.\n\n12. **Illuminator / LED** – The light source. Often paired with a **brightness control** on the base.\n\n13. **On/Off & brightness control** – Powers the lamp and sets intensity to a comfortable, non-glary level.\n\n14. **Arm** – Structural support; the safe handle when carrying the scope (other hand under the base).\n\n15. **Base & power connector** – House the lamp and electronics; provides stability.\n\n### What’s happening to the image?\n\n* **Illuminator → condenser → specimen:** Light is focused into a cone that passes through the specimen. Transparent/colored areas transmit or absorb light differently, creating contrast.\n* **Specimen → objective:** The objective produces a **real, inverted** magnified image inside the tube.\n* **Objective image → eyepiece:** The eyepiece acts like a magnifier, creating a **virtual image** your eye focuses on.\n* **Result:** High magnification with limited depth of field; tiny focus adjustments and proper illumination are crucial.\n\nIf you want, I can make a printable one-page “How it works + parts” handout using this same diagram.\n",

    "thinking_trace": "We’ll describe the optical path methodically: illuminator → condenser → specimen → objective → (optional) tube lens → inverted intermediate image → eyepiece → binocularity leading to a virtual magnified image. I’ll avoid heavy technical terms but explain key points like magnification, numerical aperture, and resolution limits (e.g., Abbe’s formula).\n\nI’ll generate a labeled image with numbered parts including the eyepiece, diopter, objectives, and more, each with a brief explanation. For example, I’ll keep it simple by showing the light path and Köhler illumination steps but leave out too much technical detail. I’ll stick to concise descriptions.\n\nI’ll avoid using code to generate the image, staying within guidelines. Instead, I’ll create the image prompt with clear instructions: a cutaway schematic of a compound light microscope with labeled parts and light path arrows, including the magnification and resolution formulas. The design will use minimal text and clear annotations.",

The tricky part is, the tool instructions say to respond with an empty message after generating the image. Would that interfere with the flow? I need to make sure I'm not violating any rules here!\n\nOkay, it seems like the tool expects the first message to be an empty response after generating the image, and then I can follow up with text. But the usual structure involves sending a message with content after the tool call. There’s a conflict between these constraints, and I need to figure out how to balance them.\n\nI'm wondering if I could reverse the usual flow. Normally, I send content and then call the tool, but the tool expects the post-call message to be empty. I wonder if that's okay. Could I send the text first, then the tool call afterward in a new message, with the text coming after that?\n\nI'm wondering if it's allowed to reverse the order or split the image and text. An alternative could be using a different tool to create a separate document for the text, then treat the image separately. But that would also show the content separately, which might break the intended format.\n\nThis is tricky! The tool says to send an empty message after generating the image, but I need to provide both the diagram and the explanation. One idea could be to first send the image, let the system enforce the empty message, and then include the explanation in a second message. But I'm not sure if that's allowed.

Often shows layers and may contain fossils.\n* **Metamorphic** – forms when any rock is **changed by heat and pressure** (without melting). Minerals **recrystallize** and may align into bands (e.g., slate, gneiss).\n\n## Main pathways (follow the arrows)\n\n1. **Magma → Igneous**: cooling & crystallization.\n2. **Igneous → Sediments**: uplift exposes rock; weathering breaks it down; erosion moves it.\n3. **Sediments → Sedimentary rock**: burial + compaction + cementation (lithification).\n4. **Sedimentary → Metamorphic**: deeper burial adds heat & pressure; minerals reorganize.\n5. **Metamorphic → Magma**: if heating goes far enough, the rock **melts**.\n6. **Shortcuts**:\n\n   * Any rock type can **weather & erode** back to **sediments**.\n   * **Igneous → Metamorphic** directly (heat & pressure).\n   * **Sedimentary → Magma** if it melts (usually via subduction).\n   * **Metamorphic → Sedimentary** if uplifted, weathered, and re-lithified.\n\n## What drives the cycle?\n\n* **Plate tectonics**: subduction drags rocks deep (heat, pressure, melting); collisions uplift mountains (exposure & weathering).\n* **Water, ice, wind**: power weathering & erosion at the surface.\n* **Heat from Earth’s interior**: fuels metamorphism and melting.\n\n## Quick ID tips\n\n* **Igneous**: interlocking crystals; sometimes glassy or with gas holes.\n* **Sedimentary**: visible grains or fossils; layered or crumbly cement.\n* **Metamorphic**: stretched/banded minerals; harder, denser versions of earlier rocks.\n\n## Big idea\n\nThe rock cycle isn’t a single loop—it’s a **network of paths**. Rocks can take many routes and spend millions of years in one stage before changing again.\n\nIf you want, I can label the diagram with a specific example path (e.g., “basalt → sand → sandstone → quartzite → magma”) or add classroom-ready annotations.\n",

The tool guidelines suggest sending an empty message after the image is generated, so I'll send the image first, and then follow up with a separate message for the explanation.

When you inhale, air enters the respiratory system through your nose and ends up in your lungs, where gas exchange with the blood takes place. In the nose, mucus and hairs trap any dust or other particles in the air. The air is also warmed and moistened so it wont harm delicate tissues of the lungs. Next, air passes through the pharynx, a passageway that is shared with the digestive system. From the pharynx, the air passes next through the larynx, or voice box. After the larynx, air moves into the trachea, or wind pipe. This is a long tube that leads down to the lungs in the chest. In the chest, the trachea divides as it enters the lungs to form the right and left bronchi (bronchus, singular). These passages are covered with mucus and tiny hairs called cilia. The mucus traps any remaining particles in the air. The cilia move and sweep the particles and mucus toward the throat so they can be expelled from the body. Air passes from the bronchi into smaller passages called bronchioles. The bronchioles end in clusters of tiny air sacs called alveoli (alveolus, singular). The alveoli in the lungs are where gas exchange between the air and blood takes place. Shown also is the rib (or ribs) the protect the lungs and other vital organs within the chest.",

    "GPT_text": "# Text Explanation (separate from the image)\n\n## Big picture\n\nYour respiratory system is a branching network that conducts air to millions of tiny sacs (alveoli) where gas exchange happens. It’s often divided into:\n\n* **Upper respiratory tract:** nose/nostrils, nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, and pharynx (throat).\n* **Lower respiratory tract:** larynx (voice box), trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and lungs (ending in alveoli).\n* **Supporting structures:** chest wall, **diaphragm**, intercostal muscles, and the **pleura** (the double-layer lining around the lungs).\n\n## The parts, in order\n\n1. **Nostrils (nares) & nasal vestibule** – entry points. Nose hairs and mucus trap dust; blood-rich lining warms and humidifies air.\n   *(If you breathe through your mouth, the first steps below are bypassed.)*\n2. **Nasal cavity & turbinates** – twisty shelves that swirl air to filter, warm, and moisten it; smell receptors live high up.\n3. **Paranasal sinuses** (frontal, maxillary, ethmoid, sphenoid) – air-filled spaces that lighten the skull and condition air; drain into the nasal cavity.\n4. **Pharynx (throat)** – three regions:\n\n   * **Nasopharynx** (behind the nose)\n   * **Oropharynx** (behind the mouth; food + air share this space)\n   * **Laryngopharynx** (leads to the larynx for air or esophagus for food)\n5. **Epiglottis** – a leaf-shaped flap that tilts down when you swallow so food doesn’t enter the airway.\n6. **Larynx (voice box)** – contains vocal cords; the opening between them is the **glottis**.\n7. **Trachea (windpipe)** – rigid tube with C-shaped cartilage rings; lined with cilia that sweep debris upward (the “mucociliary escalator”).\n8. **Carina** – the tracheal split.\n9. **Main bronchi** – right and left primary branches; the **right main bronchus** is shorter, wider, and more vertical (aspired objects lodge here more often).\n10. **Lobar (secondary) bronchi** – one to each lung lobe (3 right, 2 left).\n11. **Segmental (tertiary) bronchi** – supply bronchopulmonary segments.\n12. **Conducting bronchioles → terminal bronchioles** – small airways without cartilage; still just conducting air (no gas exchange yet).\n13. **Respiratory bronchioles → alveolar ducts → alveolar sacs → alveoli** – the **respiratory zone** where oxygen enters blood and carbon dioxide leaves across the ultra-thin alveolar–capillary membrane. Type II cells make **surfactant** to keep alveoli open.\n\n**Around the lungs:**\n\n* **Pleura:** visceral layer on the lung, parietal layer on the chest wall; a thin fluid layer lets lungs glide during breathing.\n* **Diaphragm & intercostals:** main breathing muscles.\n\n## How air travels (step-by-step)\n\n1. **Inhale:** Diaphragm contracts and moves down, ribs lift—chest cavity expands, drawing air in.\n2. **Air path:** Nostrils → nasal cavity (or mouth) → pharynx → past epiglottis → **larynx** → **trachea** → **carina** → **right/left main bronchi** → lobar bronchi → segmental bronchi → bronchioles → terminal bronchioles → **respiratory bronchioles** → **alveolar ducts** → **alveolar sacs** → **alveoli**.\n3. **Gas exchange:** Oxygen diffuses from alveoli to blood; carbon dioxide diffuses from blood to alveoli.\n4. **Exhale:** Diaphragm relaxes and moves up; lungs recoil and air flows out along the same path in reverse.\n\n## Quick memory trick\n\n**“N-N-P-L-T-B-B-b-b-A”** → Nose, Nasal cavity, Pharynx, Larynx, Trachea, Bronchi (main → lobar → segmental), bronchioles (conducting → terminal), **A**lveoli (via respiratory bronchioles & ducts).\n\n---\n\nIf you’d like, I can add labels or callouts tailored to your study needs (e.g., “conducting vs. respiratory zone,” or a zoom-in on the vocal cords).\n",

I’ll make sure to include a clear prompt and generate one image without adding any text afterwards, as per the guidelines.

Food enters the digestive system through the mouth and exits the system through the anus. The esophagus is a long tube that connects the mouth and the stomach. In the stomach, chemicals called enzymes change the food into smaller molecules that the body can use. The pancreas is the part of the digestive system that produces important enzymes and hormones that help break down foods. It is located in the abdominal cavity behind the stomach. In the small intestine, our bodies absorb the nutrients from our food. Finally, the large intestine mixes the solid waste material with water so we can easily eliminate it from our bodies through the anus. Overall, there are 9 main organs in the Digestive system.",

I’ll break it down step-by-step with bullet points, look at macronutrient digestion (carbs, proteins, fats), and mention microbiome fermentation in the colon. Additionally, I’ll create a diagram with labels and flow arrows to visually represent the digestive system.\n\nI’m going to create an infographic showing the digestive system with labeled organs and arrows to represent the flow.

It’s a two-part block:\n\n1. a **gated cross-attention (XATTN)** sublayer, and\n2. a **gated feed-forward (“DENSE”/MLP)** sublayer, each wrapped with pre-LayerNorm and residual connections.\n\n---\n\n## Inputs\n\n* **Text hidden states** (H \\in \\mathbb{R^{T\\times d}}): current LM token embeddings.\n* **Visual latents** (Z \\in \\mathbb{R^{M\\times d_v}}): a fixed set of tokens produced by the Perceiver Resampler from one or more images/video frames.\n* (Learned) **gating projections** that turn each token’s state into an element-wise gate.\n\n---\n\n## Step-by-step flow\n\n### 1) Gated Cross-Attention (XATTN)\n\n* **Pre-norm:** (\\tilde H = \\mathrm{LN}(H)).\n* **Cross-attention:** queries (Q) come from (\\tilde H); keys/values (K,V) come from (Z).\n  [\n  A=\\mathrm{MHA}(\\tilde H W_Q,\\; ZW_K,\\; ZW_V)\n    ]\n* **Gate the visual update:** compute a token-wise, channel-wise gate\n  [\n  g_x=\\sigma(\\tilde H W_{gx}+b_{gx})\\in\\mathbb{R^{T\\times d}},\n    ]\n  then modulate the cross-attn output and add residually: [\n  H^{(1)}=H + g_x \\odot A.\n    ]\n  The gate lets the layer learn **how much** each token should trust vision, often starting near “closed” so initial behavior matches the base LM.\n\n### 2) Gated DENSE (position-wise MLP)\n\n* **Pre-norm:** (\\hat H=\\mathrm{LN}(H^{(1)})).\n* **MLP/Dense:** (F=\\phi(\\hat H W_1 + b_1) W_2 + b_2) (with a standard nonlinearity (\\phi), e.g., GELU).\n* **Gate the MLP update:**\n  [\n  g_d=\\sigma(\\hat H W_{gd}+b_{gd}),\\qquad\n  H_{\\text{out}}=H^{(1)} + g_d \\odot F.\n    ]\n\n---\n\n## Why the gating?\n\n* **Stability with frozen backbones:** The LM (and typically the vision encoder) can remain frozen; new parameters are in the XATTN/DENSE paths and their gates. Gating prevents overwhelming the LM with visual signals early in training and enables smooth **modality balancing**.\n* **Token-specific control:** Gates are computed **per token** and **per channel**, so some words (e.g., nouns near image mentions) can open the visual pathway more than others.\n* **Regularization by design:** With gates near zero, the block reduces to an identity map, which curbs overfitting and preserves strong language priors.\n\n---\n\n## Placement in Flamingo\n\nThese Gated XATTN-DENSE blocks are **interleaved at several points** inside the LM stack. During inference on interleaved image–text streams, each text segment can query the relevant **cached** visual latents via the XATTN, while standard self-attention continues to handle language context.\n\n---\n\n## Summary of components\n\n* **LayerNorm (pre-norm)** before each sublayer\n* **Multi-Head Cross-Attention** (Q from text, K/V from visual latents)\n* **Learned sigmoid gates** (g_x, g_d) (element-wise modulation)\n* **Position-wise MLP (“DENSE”)**\n* **Residual connections** after both sublayers\n\nIf you’d like, I can annotate the diagram with your preferred symbols (e.g., different gate shapes, head counts, or exact tensor sizes) and export it as SVG or PDF.\n",

Each pixel has color channels (e.g., RGB).\n\n2. **Convolution Operation**: In a CNN layer, a small matrix called a filter (or kernel) slides over the image. This filter performs a dot product between itself and the section of the image it’s currently covering. It moves across the entire image, extracting features like edges, textures, or patterns.\n\n3. **Neurons**: Each neuron in the CNN layer corresponds to one region of the image processed by the filter. After the filter slides over an area of the image, the result of the convolution is passed to a neuron, which computes the weighted sum of the values and then applies an activation function (like ReLU).\n\n4. **Activation**: After the neuron processes the result, it passes the output to the next layer or saves it for further processing.\n\nNow I’ll generate an image to visualize this process.
