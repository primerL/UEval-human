Draw a curve above each eye with an oval in the middle. 3. 3. Add a line underneath the nose, then sketch a hook shape on either side. 4. 4. Draw a curve underneath the cartoon puppy face's mouth. 5. 5. Sketch a curve on either side of the face. 6. 6. Draw a rectangle with rounded edges to outline the head. 7. 7. Outline an oval for the right ear. Make sure the oval is behind the face. 8. 8. Repeat the previous step for the left ear. 9. 9. Use a wavy shape to draw a patch around your puppy face's eye. Finally, outline your easy dog face with black. Use thick lines for most of the drawing and a thin line for the patch. If you like, add a dog biscuit to give your dog a treat. 10. You can fill in your easy dog face with any color, but this guide recommends using tan for the face and dark brown for the ears, nose and patch. Leave the eyes white, and add a white highlight to the nose.",

Clean outline\n   Trace the circle cleanly (keep guidelines faint so you can erase them later).\n\n3. Eyes\n   Place two big oval eyes on the horizontal guideline, spaced about one eye-width apart. Add tiny highlights (white dots) to make them lively.\n\n4. Nose & muzzle\n   Under the eye line, draw a small upside-down triangle nose. From the sides of the nose, curve two lines down and around to form a soft “W” for the cheeks and a small smile. Add a little tongue if you like.\n\n5. Ears\n   Add two floppy, rounded triangle ears attached near the top sides of the head.\n\n6. Details\n   Add short eyebrow curves above the eyes, a small chin line, and three tiny whisker dots on each cheek (optional).\n\n7. Refine the smile\n   Thicken the mouth line slightly and round the cheeks so it looks friendly. Erase the guidelines.\n\n8. Finish\n   Add a collar and tag under the chin if desired. You can also add a patch around one eye or a few spots. Ink your final lines and color if you want.\n\nTips:\n\n* Keep everything round and soft for a cute look.\n* If you want a different breed vibe, change the ear shape (pointy for a husky, long and thin for a hound).\n* Eyes higher = younger/cuter; eyes lower = older/goofier.\n\nIf you want, I can also make a printable worksheet version.\n",

Then, Use a series of connected curved lines to draw the bushes and trees visible in the distance. 2. 2. Draw more shrubbery on the horizon using a series of connected curved lines. Then, draw a tree towering above the rest. Extend a pair of lines for the trunk, and use a curved line to enclose the tree's crown. 3. 3. Draw more trees on the horizon. Again, extend a pair of lines for the trunk, and use a curved line to enclose the tree's crown. 4. 4. Draw two large \"U\" shaped lines to outline the rainbow. Draw the sun peeking out from behind it. Use a curved line to enclose the partial circle at the center of the sun. Then, use a series of straight lines that meet at points to draw its zig zag-shaped rays. 5. 5. Draw \"U\" shaped lines within the rainbow, parallel to the outer lines, to demarcate the different colors. Then draw a daisy flower growing on the hillside. Start with an oval for the center of the flower, and \"U\" shaped lines for the petals. Draw a line below it to form the stem and a teardrop-shaped leaf on one side. 6. 6. Draw another daisy on the hillside. Again, start with an oval for the center of the flower, and \"U\" shaped lines for the petals. Nearby, draw a tulip using curved lines. Draw a line below each flower to form the stem, and a teardrop-shaped leaf on one side. 7. 7. Draw more tulips and daisies. Again, use an oval and \"U\" shaped lines for the daisy and curved lines for the tulip. Then, draw a line below each flower to form the stem and a teardrop-shaped leaf on one side. 8. 8. Draw another tulip, then some butterflies fluttering about. Use \"U\" shaped lines to form each of the butterflies' four wings. 9. 9. Complete your rainbow for kids outline by drawing clouds in the sky. Use a straight line for the bottom of each cloud and a series of curved lines for the fluffy top. 10.

At the end of the snout, draw a circle. This is the dog’s nose. Use curved lines to trace the side of the dog’s face and his forehead. Above the eyes, use curved lines to enclose the pointed eyebrows 3. 3. Draw the dog’s open, smiling mouth. Below the nose, draw a wide, curved “W” shaped line. Let it meet the nose on one side. On the other, extend the arm of the “W” all the way to the corner of the mouth. Below this, use curved lines to outline the lower jaw, the inside of the mouth, and the tongue. Contour the corner of the mouth with short lines. At the front of the snout, draw two small, triangular teeth. 4. 4. Use curved lines to enclose the rounded shapes of the dog’s ears. Then, use long curved lines to trace the top of the head, neck, and side of the body. 5. 5. Extend a long curved line below the lower jaw to form the chest. Then, use a pair of long curved lines to draw the leg. At the bottom, use overlapping curved lines to create the toes and enclose the paw. 6. 6. Contour the chest with a curved line and draw the remaining front leg. Again, use curved lines. Those at the toes should overlap. 7. 7. Draw the rear leg, bent into a sitting position, using curved lines. Again the toes should utilize overlapping curved lines. 8. 8. Draw the remaining leg of the sitting dog. Use curved lines for the back, the bent leg, and the round paw. Band the paw with short lines. 9. 9. Complete your dog cartoon outline by drawing his wagging tail. Extend two curved lines from the dog’s hip and allow them to meet at a sharp point. Beside the tail, sketch a hatch mark pattern using curved lines to simulate the motion of the tail. 10.

Add tiny white circles for highlights and fill the pupils around them. Two small curved dashes above each eye make friendly brows.\n\nBody shape\nUnder the head, draw a wide “U” shape for the chest/body.

Add a short horizontal line beneath each for the wrist opening.\n\n2. Cuffs\n   Turn each wrist line into a short “cuff cylinder”: draw a thin rectangle wrapping the base of each oval.\n\n3. Knuckle dome\n   Round the top of each oval into a smooth dome. Add a soft, shallow curve near the top front to suggest the knuckle ridge.\n\n4. Thumbs\n   On the inner side of each glove, attach a teardrop/bean shape for the thumb pad. Its tip points toward the knuckle ridge; its base connects near the cuff.\n\n5. Palm panel\n   Inside each glove, sketch a curved panel that starts under the thumb, swoops across the palm, and meets the cuff—this is the padded palm section.\n\n6. Clean silhouette\n   Trace a single confident outline around each glove (dome → front knuckle → thumb → palm → cuff). Erase construction lines.\n\n7. Details & seams\n   Add short dashed or stitched lines along the knuckle ridge, around the thumb base, and near the cuff edge. If you prefer laces, sketch a narrow opening on the front of one glove with an “X-X-X” lace pattern; otherwise add a simple strap rectangle.\n\n8. Overlap & depth\n   Decide which glove sits slightly forward. Thicken that glove’s outer contour a bit more and let it overlap the other to create depth.\n\n9. Shading\n   Pick a light source (e.g., top-left). Lightly shade the underside of the knuckle dome, the inner thumb curve, and the gap between gloves. Darken the cuff underside. Keep the top planes lighter.\n\n10. Highlights\n    Leave slim unshaded arcs along the upper knuckle and thumb to suggest glossy padding.\n\n11. Final linework\n    Go over the main contour with a steady, slightly thicker line; keep stitching and fold lines thinner so they read as surface detail.\n\n12. Color (optional)\n    Fill the gloves with a base color (classic red works well). Add a darker tone along the shaded edges and a lighter tint on top planes. Keep cuffs a touch darker than the glove body.\n\nWant the steps as a printable handout or in a different style (cartoon, realistic, vintage)? I can format that too.\n",

Use overlapping curved lines to sketch the trunk, mouth, and jaw. Notice the tusk overlapping the trunk. To draw the tusk, extend a curved line from just in front of the mouth and double it back upon itself. 3. 3. Complete the trunk using a long curved line. Note the “C” shape of the prehensile tip of the trunk. Then, enclose the ear using a long curved line. 4. 4. Enclose the remaining ear and trunk, using a curved line for each. Detail the ears with curved lines, and use another curved line to begin sketching the elephant’s chest. 5. 5. Draw the foreleg. Use a pair of roughly parallel curved lines that form a loose zigzag shape. Connect them at the bottom with a curved line. Use “U” shaped lines to indicate the toenails. 6. 6. Draw the rear leg. Again, use a pair of curved lines and connect them at the bottom. Detail the toes with “U” shaped lines. Connect the tops of each leg with a curved line, forming the belly. 7. 7. Draw the remaining foreleg. Use curved lines and connect them at the bottom. Then, extend a long curved line from the ear to the top of the rear leg to enclose the body. Detail the shoulder and hip with curved lines. 8. 8. Use a curved line to enclose the remaining rear leg, partially hidden behind the first. Draw the toenails on both the front and rear legs. Extend two curved lines from the back of the body and allow them to meet at a point, forming the tail. 9. 9. Use curved lines that meet at jagged points to enclose a tuft of hair at the tip. 10.

Erase guide lines as necessary. This forms the watermelon's stem. 3. 3. Draw two sets of wavy lines extending downward from the stem. Allow one to reach the opposite side of the watermelon. For the other pair, allow the lines to meet in a sharp point. These form the first of the watermelon's characteristic stripes. 4. 4. Draw two more stripes. Extend one set of lines down from the stem, the other up from the bottom of the melon. Allow each to end in a sharp point. 5. 5. Draw more stripes across the watermelon, filling the empty spaces. 6. 6. Next, you will draw a slice of cut watermelon. Draw a wide \"U\" shaped line, allowing it to overlap the completed watermelon. Then, connect the ends of the \"U\" using a straight line. 7. 7. Give the slice a three dimensional shape by drawing a curved line from one corner of the shape to the bottom of the shape. 8. 8. Erase the guide lines from behind the watermelon slice. 9. 9. Detail the inside of the slice. Draw a curved line parallel to the original \"U\" shaped line. This separates the green and flavorless rind from the sweet, pink fruit. Then, draw seeds. Use a teardrop shape for each seed.

The outside of the watermelon is typically striped in shades of green. The center of the melon is often pink, red, orange, or yellow.",

This is the overall slice.\n\n**Step 2 — Rind band**\nInside the arc, add a second, smaller arc that follows the first one. Leave a thin gap between them—this gap is the light-green rind.\n\n**Step 3 — Clean the edges**\nRound the two corners where the arc meets the bottom edge so the slice looks soft and juicy.\n\n**Step 4 — First seeds**\nPlace 5–7 small teardrop shapes across the pulp. Point the narrow ends toward the center.\n\n**Step 5 — Seed variety**\nAdd a few tiny dots or smaller seeds between the larger ones to make it feel natural.\n\n**Step 6 — Base colors**\nColor the pulp a bright red/pink. Fill the rind band a light green and the very outer edge a darker green. Color the seeds black.\n\n**Step 7 — Shading**\nDeepen the red slightly near the rind for a subtle gradient. Add a light, soft shadow under the slice so it sits on the page.\n\n**Step 8 — Highlights & finish**\nAdd tiny white glints on a few seeds and along the top curve. Thicken the outer outline a touch for a bold, finished look.\n\n**Optional tweaks**\n\n* Add a small “bite” notch on the top curve and adjust the seeds around it.\n* Sprinkle a couple of pale freckles on the pulp for texture.\n* Turn it into a wedge on a plate by sketching a thin oval and resting the slice on it.\n\nWant a version with fewer or more steps (e.g., a 4-step kid-friendly version)? I can spin that up too.\n",

Continue using long curved lines to enclose rounded ribs until the pumpkin has a round, full shape. 3. 3. Draw the pumpkin's thick stem. Extend two curved lines from the top of the pumpkin. From each of these, draw a long curved line. The lines should be roughly parallel and \"S\" shaped. 4. 4. Use a curved line to enclose the end of the stem. Draw another curved line across it to give the tip of the stem an oval shape. Then, texture the stem with curved lines. Use additional short lines to begin enclosing the ribs visible behind the stem. 5. 5. Complete the pumpkin's ribs. Then, draw tendrils of vine terminating from the stem. Use long, curving, \"S\" shaped lines. 6. 6. Draw a leaf along the pumpkin vine. First, extend a curved line from the vine. This forms the leaf's stem and vein. Then, use a series of connected, curved lines to outline the body of the leaf. 7. 7. Continue to draw the body of the leaf on the opposite side of the vein. Then, draw secondary veins extending from the primary vein or midrib. 8. 8. Draw the remaining veins, and begin a second leaf. Again, use a curved line for the stem and a series of curved lines to sketch the outline of the leaf. 9. 9. Complete the leaf, erasing as necessary. Finish outlining the leaf, and draw the secondary veins. 10. Color your pumpkin. Traditionally, pumpkins are orange in color. They can also be yellow, brown, green, or white!",

This forms the top of the aquarium and gives it a three-dimensional appearance. 2. 2. Begin creating the underwater scene . Draw small, round, irregular shapes in one corner to indicate a pile of pebbles. Then, draw a wavy curved line along the bottom of the tank, forming the ground or sediment. From the back corners of the trapezoid, extend vertical straight lines. These indicate the back corners of the aquarium. Notice that they don't go all the way down; the empty spaces will soon be filled with other objects. 3. 3. Draw the base of the aquarium. Use straight lines to draw the tops of the sides and the sides and bottom of the front. Then, draw a straight, horizontal line across the top of the base. 4. 4. Next, draw a castle for the fish to hide in. For the turret or tower, start with the triangle-shaped roof. Then, use curved lines for the sides, midsection, and the \"U\" shaped windows. Use curved lines to draw the central section of the castle, noting the large \"U\" shaped door. Texture the castle with full and partial rectangles, simulating bricks. 5. 5. Draw a watchtower at the top of the castle. Use small trapezoids to create the raised sections of the parapet. Connect them with curved lines, fully enclosing the castle. Then, begin drawing coral. Use curved lines to enclose the branching, tree-like shape. Finally, sketch sand along the side of the aquarium using a curved line. 6. 6. Complete the coral, using curved lines. Texture it with small \"C\" shaped lines. Then, draw the sediment at the back and side of the fish tank using a long curved line. 7. 7. Draw a plant or seaweed. For each leaf, extend two curved lines upward from the sediment. Allow them to cross back and forth over one another, enclosing several segments, before they finally meet at a point. Use curved lines to enclose and texture a seashell , as well as texturing the sand. 8. 8. Introduce the fish into their new home! Use curved lines to sketch the fish's mouth, eye, pectoral fin, body, tail, and dorsal fin. Texture the fins with curved lines. Then, draw a few circular bubbles so that the fish has plenty of air to breathe. 9. 9. Complete your fish tank outline by drawing the final fish. Follow the same steps as with the previous fish. Enclose a few more bubbles, then use wavy lines to sketch a rectangular shape at the top of the tank. This is the waterline. 10. Color your cartoon aquarium.

Draw the box\n\n* Lightly sketch a rectangle for the front.\n* Add a slightly offset rectangle behind it.\n* Connect the corners to make a clear, 3-D tank.\n\n2. Define glass edges\n\n* Darken the outer edges you want visible.\n* Keep the far back edges lighter or dashed so it still reads as glass.\n\n3. Add the waterline\n\n* Draw a horizontal line a bit below the top rim, slightly wavy for realism.\n* Show the line on the side planes too so it wraps around in 3-D.\n\n4. Pour in substrate\n\n* From the bottom back corner, sketch a gentle mound toward the front.\n* Keep edges soft; it’s sand or gravel.\n\n5. Place hardscape\n\n* Add a few smooth rocks (ovals) and a piece of driftwood (bent cylinder).\n* Overlap shapes to create depth.\n\n6. Plant it\n\n* Draw simple leaf clusters: long tapered leaves for vallisneria; bushy ovals for small plants.\n* Vary heights and angles.\n\n7. Add a fish\n\n* Start with an almond/teardrop body, triangle tail, small dorsal and pelvic fins.\n* Place one fish near the middle so it’s easy to see. Add a tiny circle eye and a small mouth.\n\n8. Equipment & bubbles\n\n* Sketch a heater or filter as a slim rectangle on a back corner.\n* Add a few bubbles rising from the substrate or filter.\n\n9. Clean-up & line weight\n\n* Erase construction lines that pass through the fish and foreground objects.\n* Thicken the front rim and foreground objects slightly; keep far edges thin.\n\n10. Shine & texture (optional color)\n\n* Add a thin highlight along the front glass edge and a couple of soft vertical streaks.\n* Dot the gravel, add light shading under rocks/plants, and, if coloring, keep water pale blue and glass mostly white with subtle reflections.\n\nWant another version (cartoony, realistic, or top-view aquascape)? I can generate a different visual set too.\n",

Then, draw an oval-shaped bead overlapping the edge of the heart. 2. 2. Draw a smaller circular bead and another oval-shaped bead. Then, begin drawing the flower-shaped bead. Draw a circle for the center of the flower and connected \"U\" shaped lines for its petals. 3. 3. Finish the petals of the flower using \"U\" shaped lines. Then, draw another oval, circle, and oval series of beads. 4. 4. Draw another, smaller heart, then another series of oval, circle, and oval-shaped beads. 5. 5. On the opposite side of the large heart, draw a series of oval, circular, and oval-shaped beads. Then, draw another daisy-shaped bead. Again, use a circle for the center of the flower and connected \"U\" shaped lines for the petals. 6. 6. Beside the flower, draw another series of oval, circle, and oval beads. Then, draw another small heart-shaped bead. 7. 7. Draw a series of oval and circle-shaped beads extending from the heart. After the last oval-shaped bead, draw a circle within a circle. This is part of the bracelet's clasp. 8. 8. Draw an oval within an oval passing through the circle within a circle. Erase as necessary. Then, draw two parallel curved lines entering the oval-shaped portion of the clasp. The lines will form a question mark shape. 9. 9. Use a curved line, doubled back on itself, to form the tip of the question mark shape. At its middle, enclose a bump - the movable arm of the clasp - using a curved line. At its base, draw a circle within a circle. Use another circle within a circle to form the chain link connecting it to the rest of the bracelet. 10. Your bracelet outline is now complete. Don't forget to color it! We've left some of our beads white like pearls, while others are blue, pink, and yellow. The clasp is yellow as if made of gold.",

Refine beads\n\n   * Plump each circle, let neighboring beads overlap slightly, and outline cleanly.\n\n7. Shade for volume\n\n   * Pick a light source (top-left works well). On each bead, shade the lower-right, leave a small highlight on the upper-left. Add a soft inner rim shadow if you kept the solid band style instead of beads.\n\n8. Finish details\n\n   * Darken contact shadows between beads, add a subtle cast shadow beneath the bracelet, and draw a tiny charm (heart, star, initial) on the loop if desired.\n\nTips\n\n* Keep ellipses symmetrical by drawing through them a few times before committing.\n* If the bracelet feels too flat, thicken the band or exaggerate bead overlap.\n* For a metal bangle: skip steps 5–6, and add bright edge highlights along the outer rim.\n\nIf you want another visual showing a **chain** or **cuff** version, say the word and I’ll add it.\n",

In the lower half of the circle, draw a pie chart or Pacman shape - a circle with a missing triangular slice. What does a Pacman shape look like, exactly? Check out this Pacman pixel art . Below each eye, extend two curved lines. These are the snail's eyestalks. Then, connect the stalks with an overlapping curved line, contouring the snail's face. 2. 2. Continue the line of the face. This line should be long and wavy, outlining the bottom of the sticky, slimy foot. 3. 3. Draw another wavy line roughly parallel to the foot, allowing the lines to meet at a point. Draw two curved lines across the face, forming the smiling mouth and the chin. Place a short curved line at the corner of the mouth. 4. 4. Extend the remaining side of the head with a long curved line. Double the line back on itself at the end to begin constructing the base of the shell. Connect the tip of the foot to the shell with a curved line. 5. 5. Begin the spiral shape of the snail shell by drawing a large \"C\" shaped line. Connect it to the snail's head with a short line. 6. 6. Continue the line of the shell to enclose the circle. Continue the line past the point of completion to begin the spiral pattern. 7. 7. Continue the spiral-shaped line. 8. 8. Enclose partial circles all along the spiral line. Notice that the circles grow smaller near the inside of the spiral. 9. 9. Fill the snail shell with more circular spots. Color your cartoon snail. We've given ours a green and yellow body with a tan and brown spotted snail. 10. Throughout much of the world, garden snails are usually brown in color. But some snails - especially the ocean and marsh-dwelling snails - have vivid black-and-white patterns or unusually bright colors .",

    "question": "How to hand-wash delicate clothing safely? Provide a visual guide and text the steps. ",
    "reference_text": "1. The tags on your clothes tell you the best ways to clean them. Read through the tag on each garment that you’re washing to see what fabric it’s made from and how to clean it properly. Keep similar fabrics together so you can wash them at the same time. Anything that can go in your machine or that has a “hand wash only” label is safe for hand-washing. If a tag says “dry clean only,” then avoid hand-washing that garment to avoid damaging it. As a quick way to check if your garments are safe to hand-wash, place a drop of water on the fabric and blot it up with a paper towel. If the color runs or bleeds, then take it to the dry cleaners. 2. Washing similar garments in the same load prevents colors from running. Sort your laundry so all the light fabrics are separated from the dark ones. Since darker colors could potentially discolor the water, wash the lightest colored clothes first and save the darker ones for last. If you have a new item of clothing that is dyed or colored, wash it separately in a different tub or basin so the color does not get on other clothing. 3. Using a stain remover beforehand makes it easier to wash out. Apply the stain remover directly over the mark on your clothes. Gently dab the stain with your fingers or brush it lightly with a new toothbrush to work the cleaner deeper into the fabric. Let the stain remover sit for about 10–15 minutes before you wash your garment. Test the stain remover in a small inconspicuous spot on your clothes before applying it directly to the stain. 4. A mild detergent meant for delicates cleans clothes more gently. Use your bathtub, sink, or large bowl depending on how many clothes you need to wash. Stick with cool or lukewarm water when you wash your clothes to prevent colors from running. Mix about 1 1 ⁄ 2 fluid ounces (44 ml) of detergent into the water until it’s completely dissolved and forms suds. [5] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Wool and fine knits: Use cold water and wool detergent to keep the fabric soft. Silk or lace: Try a no-rinse detergent to limit how much water comes in contact with the fabric. Alternatively, use mild liquid dish soap if you’re in a pinch. 5. Gently stirring the water is less damaging to clothes than scrubbing. Drop your first load of clothes into the water so they’re submerged. Then, use your hands to gently move the clothes around to wash out the dirt between the fibers. Keep agitating the water for about 2–3 minutes, or until the clothes look clean. Sweaters: Turn sweaters inside-out before washing them to clean them better. Avoid scrubbing, twisting, or rubbing your clothes together when you hand-wash them since you could stretch and damage the fabric. 6. Soaking helps lift dirt and stains deep in the fabric. Leave your clothes submerged for at least 10 minutes so the detergent has time to work through the fabric. If your clothes are really dirty or have stubborn stains, leave them in the water for up to 30 minutes so it’s even more effective. It’s normal for the water to darken as dirt lifts out of the fabric. If the water ever looks really cloudy or dirty, empty it out and refill your container. 7. A thorough rinse removes all the detergent and leftover dirt. Either empty out your container and refill it with clean water, or hold your garments underneath a running faucet. Gently squeeze your clothes as you rinse them until you don’t see any more suds coming out. Alternatively, fill a second container with clean water and transfer your clothes over to rinse them. 8. Gently squeezing your clothes prevents them from stretching. Hold your garments above the water when you squeeze them so you don’t drip. then, lay your garment flat on a towel and slowly roll the towel up to squeeze out even more water. Avoid twisting or wringing out your clothes too forcefully since you’ll stretch or damage the fabric fibers. 9. Drying your clothes flat helps them preserve their shape. While T-shirts and pants are safe to hang dry, delicate fabrics could stretch or distort. When you’re washing sweaters, silks, bras, or lingerie, spread the garments flat so they’re shaped correctly. Keep them in a well-ventilated spot and flip your clothes over after 1–2 hours so the other side can dry. Turn a fan on in the same room as your clothes to help them dry faster. Avoid putting your clothes in the dryer unless the care tag says it’s safe. Otherwise, your clothes may get damaged or shrink.",

If it says “dry clean only,” see the notes below.\n* **Sort by color & fabric.** Wash darks separately; don’t mix heavy knits with ultra-sheer pieces.\n* **Close zippers/hooks** and turn garments inside out.\n\n## Step-by-step\n\n1. **Fill the basin** with cool/lukewarm water.\n2. **Add detergent:** about **1 tsp (5 mL) per 2 L** of water (≈½ Tbsp per gallon). Swirl to dissolve.\n3. **Pre-treat spots:** dab a drop of diluted detergent on the stain; tap gently; **test in a hidden seam** first.\n4. **Submerge the garment.** Gently press out air so it’s fully wet.\n5. **Soak** for **10 minutes** (silk: 3–5 minutes).\n6. **Agitate lightly** for **30–60 seconds**—swish and squeeze the water through the fabric. **No rubbing or wringing.**\n7. **Rinse**: drain, refill with cool water, and press water through the fabric until it runs clear (repeat as needed).\n\n   * Optional final rinse: **1 Tbsp white vinegar per gallon** to reduce residue and static (skip for garments with metal trims).\n8. **Remove excess water:** lift with two hands; press against the side of the basin. **Do not twist.**\n9. **Towel-roll:** lay flat on a clean towel, roll it up, and press along the roll to absorb water.\n10. **Dry properly:**\n\n    * **Knits/wool/cashmere:** lay flat on a dry towel or rack, **reshape** to measurements.\n    * **Lingerie/synthetics:** hang or lay on a rack; avoid clothespin dents (use padded hangers).\n    * Keep away from **direct sun or heat**; **never tumble-dry** delicates.\n\n## Fabric-specific tips\n\n* **Silk:** cool water, pH-neutral detergent, short soak; blot, then lay flat or hang to drip; press inside-out with a cool iron under a pressing cloth when nearly dry.\n* **Wool & cashmere:** cold–cool water with wool wash; avoid temperature shock; always flat-dry.\n* **Lace/tulle/beaded items:** place in a **mesh bag**, minimal agitation, flat-dry.\n* **Athletic synthetics:** avoid fabric softener (it reduces wicking); hang-dry.\n\n## Stain quick help\n\n* **Protein (blood, milk):** cold water only; dab, don’t rub.\n* **Oils/grease:** pre-treat with a small drop of detergent; let sit 5–10 min, then wash.\n* **Makeup/sunscreen:** dab with detergent solution; rinse well.\n* **Dye bleed:** if water tints, stop—rinse quickly and wash separately.\n\n## When to dry-clean instead\n\n* Structured or heavily **lined** garments, tailored suits, leather/suede, or items with heavy beading/embellishment. If unsure, test a seam first or choose professional care.\n\n## Common mistakes to avoid\n\n* Hot water, bleach, fabric softener on silk/wool, vigorous scrubbing, wringing/twisting, or drying in direct heat/sun.\n\n---\n\nIf you’d like, I can regenerate the visual as a different style (minimal icons, step photos, or dark theme) or add your specific fabrics.\n",

    "reference_text": "1. Preheat your oven to 375ºF (190ºC). 2. Grease and line a 9×9 in. (23 x 23 cm.) baking tray about an inch deep. You can also line the pan with aluminum foil, if you like. If you don't have anything to line the tray with, grease the tray with butter and add a light layer of flour over. 3. Melt the butter or margarine in a small pan over low heat. While this is melting, complete the next two steps. It should take about a minute or two for the butter to melt. It'll melt faster if you start off with it at room temperature. 4. Mix the caster sugar and eggs in a separate bowl. Pour the sugar and eggs into a medium-sized bowl and stir the ingredients together until they're fully incorporated. This should take about a minute. You can use a wooden spoon, a whisk, or even an electric mixer to stir the ingredients together. 5. Mix the flour and chocolate powder together in a separate bowl. Now, pour these ingredients into a separate bowl and stir them until they are fully incorporated. 6. Pour the melted butter into the sugar and egg mixture. Then, stir until the butter is well mixed in. This will make a nice, light yellow, creamy mixture. 7. Sift in the cocoa mixture into the egg mixture a little at a time. Just pour the ingredients into a sieve and gently shake it to let the air in while the cocoa mixture falls down into the egg mixture. You can even lightly scrape a fork along the bottom of the sieve to help sift the cocoa mixture. 8. Add the chocolate chips into the mixture. Now, you can mix in the chocolate chips into the rest of the ingredients. You can use regular chocolate chips, or cute mini chips if you prefer that. If you're feeling adventurous and want to mix things up, you can also go for the white chocolate chips. [ citation needed ] 9. Pour the mixture into the baking tray. Now that the tray is greased, it should be all ready for you to pour in the mixture. Use a flat plastic mixer or knife to even out the mixture. It doesn't have to be perfectly even, but try to distribute it around the pan as evenly as you can so that the brownies are of even height throughout. [ citation needed ] 10. Insert the tray on the middle shelf of the oven and bake for 30 minutes. After 25 minutes, keep checking on the brownies to make sure they don't burn. You can even clean up while you're waiting for your brownies to cook. If you hang around the kitchen while the brownies begin to harden, you'll be craving this sweet treat even more! 11. Remove the brownies from the oven and let them cool. Wait at least five minutes for the brownies to cool. This will also give them time to harden a bit. If you cut into them when they're still cooling, it'll be harder to cut them cleanly. 12. Cut the brownies into bite-size chunks. You can cut tiny pieces, so you can devour them in one bite each. You can also cut larger brownies, so each portion is nice and hearty. It's up to you -- if you're making them for a large event, then the smaller, the better. But if you're just cooking for yourself and a few friends or family members, why not cut them to be a little bigger? You can even top them with confectioner's sugar for an extra sweet taste.",

    "question": "How to bake cookies from scratch? Provide a visual guide and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Keep everything cold. If you are using butter in your cookies (and even, to a certain degree, if you aren't) you will want to keep your ingredients refrigerator-cold. This will make your cookies much more firm and keep them from spreading out in the oven. This means that you'll have to warm up the butter enough to work with it by placing it on the counter, rather than in the microwave. Absolutely never melt it in order to mix it into the dough. A great practice is to cool your dough in the fridge for an hour before rolling it out. 2. Always cream butter and sugar. If your recipe calls for butter and doesn't specifically prohibit this practice, you should always \"cream\" the butter and the sugar first. This is a process by which you mix the two until a sort of paste is formed. 3. Try to use salted butter. Sweet cream butter tends to make cookies taste too sweet. The salt will balance out the sweetness of the cookie just enough to make it taste much better over all. You won't be able to properly taste the salt, but believe us, you'll notice the difference. 4. Change the recipe to alter the final product. If you find a recipe that you love the taste of but want a different texture, it is totally possible to alter the recipe just a bit in order to get exactly what you want! Experiment, or try these tricks: Use cake flour instead of regular flour, shortening instead of butter (or for part of the butter), or about 2 teaspoons of cornstarch along with 4 teaspoons less flour in order to get fluffy, cakey, and softer cookies. Use 2 tablespoons of milk, an extra tablespoon or two of butter, or switch your white sugar for brown to get a crispy cookie. Use melted butter to mix dough and then chill it before baking (undercook a minute or two) to get a chewy cookie. You can also use only yolks, instead of whites. Using a rubber spatula often helps speed up the mixing process if you are not using a machine. 5. Weigh your ingredients. If you find that you still struggle with getting your recipe to turn out right, bake like the pros (and Europeans!) do and weigh your ingredients. Get a good electronic kitchen scale and do your recipe based on weight. This will help ensure the perfect cookie. 6. Use an ice cream scoop to make cookies even. If you want to make sure that every cookie in a batch turns out looking the same, use an ice cream scoop to get perfectly equal balls of dough. 7. Use parchment paper. Skip the Silpat in favor of parchment paper. Silpat can make it difficult for cookies to cook evenly and it also keeps the bottoms from developing that perfect crispness. Parchment paper turns out a much better cookie. 8. Bake on the bottom of your cookie sheet. If you notice that the cookies at the edge of your sheet are prone to getting over cooked, use an Round or oval pan. If you don't have one, improvise and flip the pan over to use the bottom! 9. Know your oven. Every oven is different and it is important for you to know how yours behaves. If you know what to expect, then you can find ways to work around the expected problems. For example, if you notice that cookies on one corner or side bake faster than in another, make sure you turn the pan part-way through the baking process. 10. Start with a cold pan. Put your baking sheet in the fridge to cool before you put each set of cookies on. If you want to save time, you can scoop the dough onto parchment paper and store them in the fridge until they are ready to go out on a cooled pan. This means cooling the pan between each set of 12 too! 11. Don't overbake your cookies. If anything it's better to under-bake them. For the first batch carefully watch them and time for when they get the first hint of brown at the edges. Edge browning usually means you've gone too far, though these cookies are still perfectly good (especially if you like yours crispy!). Once you know how long it takes to reach that point, pull them out maybe 30 seconds before they brown for perfectly soft cookies. If you are using white chocolate chips in your cookies, be careful, as they can burn particularly easily. 12. Let cookies sit on the pan. Let your cookies sit on the pan for a few minutes before taking them off. This will let them firm up on the bottom, making them much easier to remove.",

Line a baking sheet with parchment.\n\n2. **Dry mix**\n   Whisk **flour, baking soda, and salt** in a bowl; set aside.\n\n3. **Cream**\n   In a separate bowl, beat **butter + both sugars** on medium until **pale and fluffy (1–2 min)**.\n\n4. **Eggs & vanilla**\n   Beat in **egg, then yolk, then vanilla** just until smooth.\n\n5. **Combine**\n   Add dry ingredients. Mix on low or fold until **just combined** (no dry streaks; avoid overmixing).\n\n6. **Chocolate**\n   Fold in chocolate.\n\n7. **Scoop & (optional) chill**\n   Scoop **2 Tbsp (40–45g)** mounds, well-spaced. For thicker cookies, **chill 15–30 min**.\n\n8. **Bake**\n   Bake **10–12 min** until **edges are set and lightly golden** and **centers still look soft/puffy**.\n\n9. **Set & cool**\n   Cool on the sheet **5 min**, then transfer to a rack. They’ll finish setting as they cool.\n\n## Doneness Cues\n\n* Edges: lightly golden;\n* Centers: soft, a touch pale;\n* Surface: faint cracks with glossy melted chocolate.\n\n## Pro Tips\n\n* **Temperature matters:** butter should be soft but cool (no oily sheen).\n* **Thickness control:** Chill longer for thicker cookies; bake right away for thinner, chewier edges.\n* **Wrinkly tops:** Halfway through baking, **rap** the pan once on the rack.\n\n## Variations\n\n* **Browned-Butter:** Brown 170 g butter; cool till just fluid, then proceed. Adds a nutty note (cookies spread a bit more).\n* **Nutty Crunch:** Add ½ cup toasted chopped pecans or walnuts.\n* **Salted:** Finish with a **pinch of flaky salt** after baking.\n* **Oat-Choc Chip:** Swap 50 g (½ cup) of flour for quick oats.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n* **Too flat:** Butter too warm; dough under-chilled; oven too cool.\n* **Too cakey/dry:** Over-measured flour; overbaked; overmixed.\n* **Greasy edges:** Butter too warm; try chilling 30–60 min.\n\n## Storage & Make-Ahead\n\n* **Baked:** Airtight at room temp **3–4 days**.\n* **Dough balls:** Freeze on a tray, then bag; bake from frozen **12–14 min** at 350°F.\n\n——\n\nI’ll now generate a separate step-by-step visual guide that matches this recipe. 😊\n\n\nIf you’d like the visual saved as a printable PDF or with different colors/sizes, tell me your preference and I’ll regenerate it to match.",

    "question": "How to boil pasta perfectly? Provide a visual guide and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Fill a large pot about 2/3 full of water. Since the pasta needs lots of room to move around as it cooks, use a big pot. For example, if you'll be cooking a 1 pound (450 g) box of pasta, get out a pot that's at least 4 US quarts (3.8 L) in size. Then, pour in enough water to come 2/3 up the side of the pot. If you use a pot that's too small, your pasta is more likely to clump together as it cooks. 2. Cover the pot and bring the water to a boil. Set the pot of water on the stove and put a lid on it. Turn the burner to high and let the water come to a boil. You'll know the water is boiling when you see steam escaping from under the lid. Covering the pot with a lid will make the water boil faster. 3. Add salt and 1 pound (450 g) of pasta to the boiling water. Once the water boils vigorously, remove the lid and add 1 tablespoon (17 g) of salt and 1 pound (450 g) of pasta. If you're cooking long noodles, such as spaghetti, that don't fit in the pot, wait about 30 seconds and then push them into the water using a spoon or pasta fork. The salt will season the noodles as they cook, which will give you flavorful pasta. If you're unsure how many servings of pasta to cook, check the side of the box for recommended serving sizes. 4. Set a timer for 3 to 8 minutes. Stir the noodles with a pasta fork to break the noodles up and leave the lid off the pot. Then, check the pasta package for a recommended cooking time and set a timer for the minimum time that's suggested. For example, if the box says to cook the noodles for 7 to 9 minutes, set a timer for 7 minutes. Thin pasta, such as angel hair, will cook faster than thick or long noodles, such as fettuccine or penne, which take closer to 8 or 9 minutes. 5. Stir the noodles occasionally as they boil. The water should continue to bubble as the pasta cooks. Stir it every few minutes to prevent the noodles from sticking together. If the water looks like it might boil over the sides of the pot, turn the burner down to medium-high. 6. Bite into a noodle to see if it's cooked enough for you. Carefully scoop a noodle out of the water when the timer beeps and set it aside to cool a little. Bite into the noodle to tell if it's still hard in the center or if it's as soft as you like. Most people prefer to cook pasta until it's al dente, which means it's still a little firm in the center. If the pasta is still too hard for your liking, boil it for another minute before checking it again.",

    "generated_text": "Here’s your **text guide**. The **visual guide** is attached above as an infographic.\n\n# Text Guide: How to Boil Pasta Perfectly\n\n1. Pick the pot + water\n\n* Use a big pot so pasta can move freely.\n* Water: **4–6 quarts (4–5.5 L) per 1 lb / 450 g** pasta.\n\n2. Salt like the sea\n\n* Add salt once the water is hot but before the pasta goes in.\n* Aim for **1–2% salinity** (about **1½–2 Tbsp kosher salt** or **1 Tbsp table salt** per 4–6 quarts). This seasons the pasta itself.\n\n3. Rolling boil first\n\n* Wait for a **vigorous, rolling boil (100°C / 212°F)** before adding pasta. Lids help you get there; remove the lid once boiling.\n\n4. Add pasta & stir early\n\n* Drop pasta in and **stir for the first 1–2 minutes** to prevent sticking, then stir occasionally.\n\n5. Cook to al dente (taste, don’t guess)\n\n* Start tasting **2 minutes before** the package’s low end.\n* Al dente = cooked through with a pleasant bite and no chalky center.\n\n6. Save some pasta water\n\n* **Reserve ½–1 cup** starchy water before draining. It helps sauces cling and lets you adjust thickness.\n\n7. Drain, don’t rinse\n\n* **Do not rinse** (you’ll wash off starch). Only rinse if making a **cold pasta salad**.\n\n8. Marry pasta with sauce\n\n* Finish pasta **in a pan with the sauce** for 1–2 minutes, loosening with splashes of reserved water and finishing with a knob of butter or olive oil if desired. Season to taste.\n\n9. Rest & serve hot\n\n* Let it sit **30–60 seconds** off heat to settle the sauce; plate immediately.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Timing Reference (start tasting early!)\n\n* **Fresh pasta (eggs)**: 2–4 min\n* **Dry thin long (spaghetti, linguine)**: 8–10 min\n* **Dry short (penne, rigatoni, fusilli)**: 9–12 min\n* **Thick/shape with ridges or whole wheat**: 11–13+ min\n* **Gluten-free**: often **less forgiving**—taste frequently in the last few minutes.\n\n---\n\n## Common Mistakes & Fixes\n\n* **Pot too small** → water cools off and pasta sticks. Use a larger pot.\n* **Under-salting** → flat flavor. Salt the water properly.\n* **Adding pasta before a full boil** → gummy texture. Wait for the rolling boil.\n* **Not stirring early** → clumps. Stir in the first 1–2 minutes.\n* **Overcooking** → mush. Taste early and often.\n* **Rinsing after draining** → sauce won’t cling. Don’t rinse unless for cold dishes.\n\n---\n\n## Pro Tips\n\n* For silky sauces, emulsify: **toss pasta + sauce + reserved water** over medium heat until glossy.\n* Cooking for later? **Undercook by ~1 minute**, then finish in sauce when reheating.\n* High altitude: water boils at a lower temp—**add a minute or two** and rely on tasting.\n\nIf you want, I can tailor the infographic for a specific pasta shape or serving size.\n",

    "question": "How to Exfoliate Your Body for Soft Skin? Provide a visual guide and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Have a bath or shower. While not part of the exfoliating process per se, immersing your body in hot water will open up your pores, making your skin much more susceptible to cleaning. It also helps to do this process in the bathroom, as you'll need a ready supply of hot water and somewhere to wash away the dead skin flakes once they've been scrubbed off. Use a skin-friendly, perfume-free detergent for bath and allow at least 15 minutes to soften (macerating) the skin surface. It is good when the skin surface looks a bit \"deformed\". Remove \"dead skin\" by rubbing it away with your hands. It will work well, especially at your feet, toes and heels. 2. Get a textured sponge to wash your skin. Tending to your skin with it will help rub away excess skin flakes, leaving your skin softer and cleaner than before. It is recommended you have a sponge ready for use once you have finished up your shower. It should feel slightly rough on your skin, but if it's abrasive to the point of pain, exfoliating wash cloths are a suitable, gentler alternative. Exfoliating can also be done with a rough washcloth. A natural bristle brush makes for a good alternative, particularly while scrubbing the backs of arms or legs. If you're the do-it-yourself type, you might look into making your own loofah from home. 3. Scrub your body gently with your sponge starting from the ankles upward. Scrub the sponge over your skin in small, circular motions. Make sure to apply some pressure to feel the sponge's rough texture on your skin; that way, it will rub the surface-layer dead skin away. Starting at the ankles is recommended because it helps to encourage positive blood circulation during the exfoliation process. healthglamour.com/how-to-exfoliate-the-body/ If you're exfoliating your entire body, make sure to give extra attention to your heels, elbows, and knees. These are generally considered to be the driest parts of one's skin, and should be given greater attention accordingly. 4. Add wet sand or salt to your full body exfoliation. If you've ever walked along the beach barefoot, you may have noticed your foot callouses soften. Sand granules are a naturally occurring exfoliant, and their grainy texture is well-suited to scraping away your excess skin flakes. Salt scrubs do the same thing. You can find sand and salt exfoliating products at any store that sells beauty and skincare products. Be forewarned: Using sand in the bath can cause a bigger mess than more common exfoliants. Although it is recommended to try it out at least once, it may not be the best course of action if you don't have the added time in your routine available to do a bit of cleaning up afterwards. Getting sand down a drain could completely ruin the plumbing pipes if done often. If using sand, it should be cleaned, even bleached, because getting it from outdoors could introduce bacteria and using that to exfoliate would do more harm than good. Choose sand with small granules, not big, because the smaller granules are more gentle on the skin. Focus on the tougher skin of the arms and legs because sand can be more intense than exfoliating scrubs. 5. Rinse with hot water. Closing up shop with a body rinse is a relaxing and effective way to finish your exfoliation. Although it's recommended you repeat this process at least three times a week, you should notice an immediate softness with your skin. Applying a moisturizer or shea butter following your rinse, even following an otherwise purely 'mechanical' cleanse, will help your skin better retain moisture.",

Skip if skin is inflamed.\n* **Chemical (acids/actives):**\n\n  * **AHAs** (lactic, glycolic): dry/dull or uneven texture.\n  * **BHA** (salicylic): body breakouts, clogged pores, ingrowns.\n  * **PHA** (gluconolactone, lactobionic): very sensitive skin.\n  * **Urea** (10–20%): rough bumps/keratosis pilaris (KP).\n\n## 2) Step-by-step routine (shower days)\n\n1. **Soak** in warm (not hot) water for 5–10 min.\n2. **Cleanse** with a gentle, non-stripping body wash.\n3. **Exfoliate**\n\n   * *Physical:* massage with light pressure in small circles for 30–60 sec per area; avoid chest/neck if sensitive.\n   * *Chemical:* apply a thin layer per label. Rinse-off: 1–3 min. Leave-on lotions: use a light, even coat—don’t scrub.\n4. **Rinse & pat dry** (don’t rub).\n5. **Moisturize within 3 minutes.** Look for glycerin, hyaluronic acid, ceramides; for very dry skin, seal with a light oil/occlusive.\n6. **Daytime SPF 30+** on exposed areas (AHAs/BHAs increase sun sensitivity).\n\n## 3) How often?\n\n* **Sensitive:** 1×/week (soft cloth or PHA).\n* **Normal/combination:** 1–2×/week.\n* **Dry/KP-prone:** 2–3×/week (lactic acid or urea, avoid gritty scrubs).\n* **Oily/acne-prone:** 2–3×/week BHA on problem zones (back, chest).\n\n> Signs you’re overdoing it: stinging that lasts, tightness, shiny but fragile skin, more redness or breakouts.

    "reference_text": "1. Wash your hands before cleaning your glasses. Wash up for 20 seconds with lotion-free soap and warm water. You’ll need to make sure your hands are free of dirt, grease, and grime before cleaning your glasses. 2. Rinse your glasses with warm water. Run a gentle stream of tap water over your glasses. Rotate them to wet both sides of each lens, the frame, and earpieces. Hot water is bad for lenses, protective coatings, and the frame, so be sure to use warm water. 3. Use your fingertips to carefully lather them with dish soap. Add a small drop of lotion-free dish soap to each lens. Make gentle circular motions with your fingertips to lather the soap over both sides of your lenses, around the frame, and down each earpiece. 4. Clean the nose pads with a cotton swab or soft toothbrush. Use gentle pressure as you scrub the nose pads and the crevices between them and the frame. If you’re using a toothbrush, make sure it’s soft-bristled. Avoid grazing the lenses with the toothbrush, even if it’s soft-bristled. If there’s buildup between the lenses and the frame, use a cotton swab to loosen it. 5. Wash away soap residue. Hold the glasses under running water again to rinse away soap suds. Make sure you’ve washed away all traces of soap, as any remaining residue will cause smudges. 6. Shake off excess water and make sure your lenses are clean. Turn off the water, then give your glasses a careful shake. Check the lenses to make sure they’re clear, and wash them again if you see any smudges. 7. Dry your glasses with a microfiber cloth. Fold a clean microfiber cloth over both sides of a lens. Make soft circular motions with your fingertips to dry it, then repeat on the other lens. Wipe the nose pads, then use the cloth to dry and polish the frame and earpieces. [6] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source 8. Spray your glasses liberally with eyeglass cleaner. Spray cleaners for eyewear are available at pharmacies and eyewear retailers. If you can’t get to a sink and dish soap, spray your glasses with lots of cleaner to flush away dirt and debris. Some eyewear manufacturers and optometrists also offer free samples of spray cleaner. If you have anti-reflective (AR) glasses, make sure the cleaner you use is labelled safe for the AR coating. 9. Wipe away the cleaner with a microfiber cloth. After spraying your glasses, carefully wipe off excess cleaner. Fold the cloth over both sides of each lens, and make gentle circular motions with your fingertips to absorb the cleaner. Then use the cloth to dry the frame and earpieces. 10. Touch up your lenses with disposable eyeglass wet wipes. You can also clean your glasses with wet wipes when you’re on the go. Gently blow on them to remove dust and dirt, then gently rub them with a wet wipe using soft, circular motions. After cleaning them, dry them with a microfiber cloth. Only use wet wipes labelled for cleaning eyewear. If you have AR glasses, make sure your wipes are labelled safe for the AR coating. 11. Clean your glasses every morning and as needed. Make cleaning your glasses part of your morning routine. Check them regularly throughout the day, and touch them up as needed. Keeping your glasses clean and smudge-free will help prevent scratches. 12. Store your glasses in a hard case when you’re not wearing them. Don’t just throw your glasses in your purse or bag, and avoid placing the lenses on hard surfaces. When they’re not in use, keep them in a hard-shell case. The case should fit your glasses; if it’s too big, they might roll around and get damaged. [11] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source 13. Wash your microfiber cloths frequently. Microfiber cloths collect grease and dirt, so you should wash yours after 2 or 3 uses. Some cloths are machine washable, so check the care instructions and launder them as directed. [12] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source If your cloth isn’t machine washable, or if you’re not sure, hand wash it with dish soap, wring it out, then let it air dry. 14. Don’t wipe your glasses with your shirt, tissue, or a paper towel. Shirts, tissues, and paper towels contain fine debris that could scratch your glasses. Additionally, never wipe your glasses when they’re dry, or you’ll risk damaging them. Exhaling on your glasses and wiping them with your shirt might be convenient, but that’s a quick way to scratch up your lenses. Need help keeping your glasses clean?

    "question": "How to change a flat tire safely on the roadside? Provide a visual guide and text the steps. ",
    "reference_text": "1. Find a safe area where traffic won’t be a risk. If you are near a road, park as far from traffic as possible and turn on your emergency hazard lights. Don’t park on an incline to keep your vehicle from rolling away, and stay off of soft soil or grass. If you have to drive slowly for a block or two to get to a safe, flat area, then so be it.Examples of safe areas are as follows: The shoulder of the highway, a public parking lot, or a large space with no pedestrian activity. Apply the parking brake once you’re parked to ensure the vehicle doesn’t move. For added peace of mind, place heavy rocks or blocks around each tire you aren’t changing to keep the vehicle from rolling. 2. The spare will likely be underneath a cover in the trunk. Every make and model will be a little bit different, but your spare should be under the cloth or plastic cover at the bottom of your trunk. Retrieve the wheel from the trunk. Also, remove the jack and the tire iron you need to remove the lug nuts. The tools for completing the change - including the jack, and lug wrench - will be located near the spare tire. On most vehicles, the tire iron is part of the jack. You’ll use it to turn the bolt on the end of the jack to raise or lower it, and also to remove the lug nuts on the tire. If you drive a Jeep or a large SUV, the spare tire may be on the outside or underneath the vehicle. If you don’t have a spare, your vehicle may have a sealant kit to temporarily patch your flat tire . If you don’t have that either, call a tow truck. 3. Move around your vehicle and check for any damaged components or wheels. This article focuses on replacing damaged tires - be sure to contact roadside services in the event you are experiencing any issues you cannot safely handle yourself either due to lack of experience, tools, replacement parts, or severity of the damage. 4. Provided you have the tools necessary, find a solid point on the frame of your vehicle to elevate the portion of the car near the wheel you need to replace. Remember to place the jack in a position that won't be hit by yourself or others, risking the vehicle being dropped from the jack. Elevate the vehicle until the tire is no longer touching the ground (recommended 1-2 inches) Place the jack on a part of the frame that will not damage or warp components of your vehicle, causing more damage. Begin to lift the vehicle by pressing down on the floor jack or by turning the floor jack handle slowly. You will begin to see the tires lift from the ground. To have enough room to dismount the tire, you want to make sure that the tire is at least lifted 3-6 inches from off the ground. Grab your jack stands. These are used as a safety precaution so that the vehicle doesn't fall to the ground in case your floor jacks break or slip. The owner's manual will show you where to place them. To engage the jack stands, use the lever that is attached to them and line it up with the jack stand point (Usually indicated by an arrow engraved into the car) but only raise the stand to about an inch or two away from the jack stand point which is usually the frame of the car. CAREFULLY release the pressure from your floor jack so that the vehicle falls into place with the jack stands 5. Remove the hubcap and loosen the nuts part-way. Start with the lowest bolt and avoid causing damage to the undamaged bolts/lug nuts. Pry the hubcap off using the flat end of your tire iron or a flathead screwdriver. Do not remove the lug nuts entirely. Just use the end of the tire iron to loosen the nuts by turning them counterclockwise so that there’s no longer any resistance. You should be able to spin the nuts by hand, but they shouldn’t be so loose that they spin freely. By keeping the wheel on the ground when you first loosen the nuts, you'll make sure that you're turning the nuts instead of the wheel. Your tire iron may have different sizes of openings on each end. The correct end for the nut will slip easily onto it, but it won’t be so loose that it rattles. If your vehicle doesn’t have a hub cap, don’t worry about that part. If it does, your hub cap may have a center cap that needs to be unscrewed first. On some newer vehicles you need a special “key” to unlock one of the lug nuts as a theft prevention strategy. Look in your glove box and trunk for a special tool that’ll remove that unique lug nut. These lug nuts will have a unique groove inside of them. Use the key to remove the locking lug nut. Keep all bolts as you will be using them to connect your spare tire to your car. 6. Place the divot in the jack directly under the metal rim of the frame. Get on the ground and use the flashlight on your phone to take a closer look. Touch the area directly behind the metal body of your exterior to feel and look for a thin, metal length. This is your frame. Set the jack underneath the frame right next to the tire you’re replacing. Many cars have molded plastic along the bottom. If you don't place the jack in the right spot, it will crack the plastic when you start lifting. If you're not sure about the right place to put the jack, read your owner's manual. There may be a small notch or mark just behind the front wheel wells, or in front of the rear wheel wells where the jack is intended to be placed. 7. Use the jack to raise your tire 4–6 inches (10–15 cm) off of the ground. Turn the handle of the jack clockwise to begin raising the platform up. Once the platform on the jack makes contact with the vehicle, take a look at the point where the jack meets the frame to confirm it’s on your frame. If it isn’t, loosen the jack and reposition it. If it is, continue to lift your vehicle off the ground . The vast majority of jacks are scissor jacks. You use the tire iron or a rod to twist the nut on the side and hoist the vehicle. You might have a pump-assisted jack, though. With a pump jack, you repeatedly move the handle up and down to raise the vehicle hydraulically. This can be kind of freaky the first time you do it. You might think your jack is going to snap or your car is going to tilt over. Don’t worry! Your jack and vehicle are designed to handle this. It can take a few minutes and a lot of elbow grease to get that vehicle up, so feel free to take breaks if you need to. It’s worth double-checking to make sure the jack is on the frame. You really don’t want to damage your vehicle with the jack. Make sure the vehicle is secure in the air by pressing down on the side of the vehicle that is jacked up in the air. Next, you need to add some wheel chalks to the opposite side wheels of the vehicle. If you have the car jacked from the front left side of the vehicle, then you would want to place two wheel-chocks under the rear tires to prevent the vehicle from rolling. 8. Pop the nuts off by hand and pull the tire off. You already loosened the nuts, so removing them should be fairly easy. Use the tire iron and brace the tire with your non-dominant hand if you need to. With all of the lug nuts removed, slide your busted wheel off of the axle and set it aside. Flip your hubcap upside down to turn it into a small bowl and set your lug nuts inside so that you don’t lose them. Use the proper body mechanics when dismounting a tire. Mounting and dismounting a tire is very tiresome and heavy on your back so you always want to make sure you squat using your legs with your back straight. Never place your legs under the vehicle while it's lifted up because that's a safety hazard. If you can, grab a small mechanics chair as this will help secure your back. 9. The side of the spare with the valve stem on it faces out. Line the lug nut bolts up with the openings on the spare and slide the spare on to the axle - holding the tires at the positions of 4 and 8, lifting the tire slightly and pulling the tire out. The valve stem is the little rubber pipe that sticks out where you add air to the tire. If it’s pointed inward towards the body of the vehicle, the tire is backwards. Fun fact, the spare tire is also known as a “donut.” Take one of the bolts you removed from the old tire, take your spare tire, and align the sockets on the tire rim with the sockets on the tire mount, then place the tire on the mount. Insert the bolt into the topmost socket and rotate the bolt into its socket enough to ensure the tire will not fall off the mount, but not too tightly as to fully insert the bolt into the socket. Grab the tire using proper body mechanics (this is important for your physical health) by getting down on one knee and rolling the tire onto your foot. Carefully lift with your arms and foot to align the tire with the hub. Align the tire with the wheel hub. Press the tire and wheel against the hub so that it sits completely flushed and symmetrical with the hub bearing (this is important for tightening reasons). Keep your foot pressed onto the tire to secure it. Begin screwing the lug nuts back on. First, you want to make sure that you're hub cap is securely placed back on. Start with one lug nut and thread it all the way down on the wheel stud to help hold the tire on the hub. 10. Don’t tighten the nuts using the tire iron just yet. Gently slide each over the bolt and tighten it by hand to partially lock them in place. You will tighten the lug nuts again once the car is down and there is no risk of it falling. Just to clarify, use the same lug nuts that were previously on your wheel. You don’t need special lug nuts for the spare. 11. With the wheel on the axle, lower the jack and remove it. Turn the handle or bolt on the jack counterclockwise to begin lowering the vehicle. Continue lowering the vehicle until the tire is comfortably back on the ground. Then, carefully remove the jack from underneath and set it back in your trunk. [8] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Keep your entire body out from underneath the vehicle. If the jack slips your vehicle gets closer to the ground, you don’t want your body underneath it. 12. Completely tighten the nuts until they won’t turn any further. Using the tire iron, tighten each nuts 3-4 times and then move on to the lug nut on the opposite side. Work in a star pattern to ensure the nuts are secured in an even pattern. Continue tightening the nuts in a cycle until all of the lug nuts are completely secure. [9] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source After you’ve tightened each nut, try to tighten each nut one more time to ensure they’re as tight as they can possibly get. Put your busted tire in the trunk alongside the jack and tire iron. 13. Remove and release all of the jacks from the car. Start off by lifting the vehicle up from the jack stands by using the floor jacks. Do this to make sure you are able to remove the jack stands. Remove the jack stands from under the vehicle. Remove the old tire and wheel assembly. Release the pressure from the floor jack by slowly turning the lever to the left and you will start to see the vehicle slowly fall to the ground. Once the vehicle is fully on the ground. Remove the floor jack. Remove wheel chocks. 14. Keep your speed under 50 miles per hour (80 km/h) and don't go further than 50 miles (80 km). If your spare is a full-size tire (rather than a donut), you can drive the same way you normally would. Check your tire pressure and fill your spare with air as needed. This is especially important if the spare has been in your trunk for a while, since it may have leaked a little in storage. [10] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Head to an auto shop as soon as you can. Small punctures can usually be repaired for $15-100. If the tire is not repairable, you may need to buy a replacement tire.",

Never crawl under the vehicle.\n\n## Tools you’ll need\n\n* Spare tire (compact “donut” or full-size)\n* Jack and **owner’s-manual jack point locations**\n* Lug wrench (and locking-lug key if you have one)\n* Wheel chocks, gloves, flashlight, and warning triangle/cones (if available)\n\n## Step-by-step\n\n1. **Prep the area**\n   Place a warning triangle 100–200 ft (30–60 m) behind the car if safe to do so.\n\n2. **Expose the lugs**\n   Remove the hubcap/wheel cover if present.\n\n3. **Break the lug nuts loose**\n   With the wheel **still on the ground**, use the lug wrench to loosen each nut about ½–1 turn. Push down with your foot if needed; don’t fully remove them yet.\n\n4. **Position the jack at the correct jack point**\n   Check your manual for the reinforced spot near the flat tire. Never jack on plastic trim or thin metal.\n\n5. **Lift the vehicle**\n   Raise until the flat tire just clears the ground by an inch or two (2–5 cm). Keep your body and limbs out from under the car.\n\n6. **Remove the flat wheel**\n   Spin off the loosened lug nuts and set them in a safe spot (a hubcap works). Pull the wheel straight off the hub.\n\n7. **Mount the spare**\n   Line up the holes with the studs; slide the wheel fully onto the hub. Thread the lug nuts **by hand** until snug.\n\n8. **Initial tighten in a star pattern**\n   Using the wrench, snug the nuts in a **star/ criss-cross** sequence—do not fully torque yet.\n\n9. **Lower the vehicle and final tighten**\n   Lower the car until the tire just contacts the ground and the jack is free. Now fully tighten the nuts in the **same star pattern** until firmly secure. (Later, torque to your vehicle’s spec.)\n\n10. **Stow and check**\n    Put the flat and tools away, remove chocks/triangle, and check the spare’s pressure. For compact spares, **observe the sidewall limits** (often around 50 mph / 80 km/h and short distances). Drive to a tire shop for repair or replacement **as soon as possible**.\n\n## Extra tips\n\n* If a nut won’t budge, apply steady pressure rather than jerky motions; a short pipe over the wrench handle can help (carefully).\n* If the jack sinks on soft ground, place a solid board under it.\n* After 5–10 miles (8–16 km), **re-check lug nut tightness**.\n* If you have **TPMS**, the warning light may stay on until the repaired tire is back on.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can also turn these steps into a printable one-page checklist or add car-specific jack points based on your make/model.\n",

    "question": "How to organize your closet? Provide illustrated steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Remove all of the clothes from your closet. Take all of your clothes off their hangers and out of any bins or drawers in your closet. Fold them in piles on the floor or on your bed. This includes your shoes as well. It may also include other accessories such as belts, scarves, purses, or ties. 2. Decide which clothes you will keep. You may have the urge to keep everything, or toss everything. But go through systematically and piece by piece to really scrutinize your clothing. What you want in your closet are clothes that you wear on a regular basis, that fit you and are functional, and fit in the space available. Does the item fit? Clothing in the closet should fit you properly, neither too loose nor too tight. It typically means it is comfortable, not pinching, clothing can button easily, and no red marks left on the skin. It may also mean letting go of items no longer in fashion, such as skin tight skirts you really should not wear to your professional job. It is usually best to let go of \"inspirational items\" such as the jeans you hope to someday fit back into; trends being what they are the item may well be out of fashion when you do lose the weight. One pair of \"fat pants\" may be OK to remind you of your weight loss accomplishment. If your weight is fluctuating up or down (such as in growing young adults, pregnant women, or dieters) this may be tricky. Still, get rid or store items that clearly do not fit you. Do I wear this? Have you worn the item in the last year? How often do you wear it: once a week or only once this year? If you have not worn the item in a long time, that may well indicate it is time to let go. Special use items may be OK to keep even if used only periodically. You might have a Christmas sweater, or interview outfit, or formal dress that isn't used often but still worth having available. Do I like this? If you really don't like an item, do not keep it. In general, do not hang onto items out of guilt--such as that shirt your father bought you but you just do not like. Do I have multiples of this? Work or school uniforms are one thing. But if you have seven black almost identical t-shirts, that might be a sign to let go of a few. Make a \"Keep\" pile for the clothes that you will keep and wear on a regular basis. 3. Decide which clothes you will store. You should store the clothes that you won't be wearing for a while because they aren't seasonally appropriate. If it's the middle of summer, you can store your winter sweaters and scarves, and if it's the dead of winter, you can store your tank tops and summer dresses. You can also store clothes that may have sentimental value for you, such as a shirt your grandmother knitted for you, or an old t-shirt from your high school tennis team that no longer fits. Try to keep the sentimental value clothes to a minimum, though. Clothes are meant to be worn, after all. Consider displaying beloved clothing instead of keeping them in your closet. Consider framing your prized concert T-shirt, or creating a shadow box of your Boy Scout uniform and awards, or make a T-shirt quilt of your old marathon shirts. When you're done sorting through the clothes you will store, put them in a plastic bin or a clear bag marked keep. You can either store them in the back of your closet, under your bed, or in a storage unit or a different part of your home if you have the room. 4. Decide which clothes you will donate or throw out. This is the hardest step, and the most important. If you want to have a truly organized closet, then your goal should be to get rid of as many items of clothing as possible. This doesn't mean you should throw out your favorite things - however, it does mean that you should take a long hard look to ask yourself which clothes you will actually ever wear again. If you haven't worn something in over a year and it has no sentimental value, it's time to donate it. If you have an item that is so worn, covered in moth holes, or faded that you and anyone else will never wear it again, then it's time to throw it out. If you have a few items of clothing that are just way too small, stop waiting for the day that they will fit and donate them. Donate all of the clothes you don't need that are in good condition, or give them to a sibling or friend. 5. Clean the inside of the closet. You should do this before you put back your clothes. Vacuum or sweep the floor, wipe the walls down with all-purpose cleaner, and sweep away any cobwebs that may have accumulated there. If you want to make any changes, such as painting the inside a different color or adding and removing some shelves, do it now. 6. Hang up your clothes and organize them. Try to hang up as many of your clothes as you can. This will make it easier for you to find your clothes and to conserve space. You should not only hang up your clothes, but you should also organize them in a particular way so you can easily find them whenever you need to. Here are some ways to organize the clothes you hang up: Organize your clothes by season. If you've stored away some of your seasonal clothes, organize your clothes by season just for half the year. If it's summer, hang up your summer clothes first, followed by your fall clothes. Organize your clothes by type. You can separate your tank tops, shirts, pants, skirts, and dresses. Organize your work and casual clothes. Separate your work clothes from your casual clothes so you can easily get dressed for work in the morning. Organize your clothes by how often you wear them. You can choose any method of organization, but hang up a few key items, like your favorite hoodie or the pair of jeans you wear all the time, in the most accessible place. If you really want to step it up a notch, you can use differently colored hangers to mark a different type of clothing. For example, you can hang your tops on pink hangers, or your work clothes on green hangers. Colour code your clothes. example in rainbow colours You can also think about installing another pole to hang up your additional clothes. 7. Put additional clothes in other parts of your closet. Once you've hung up all of the clothes fit on your pole, you should find other parts of the closet to store the rest of your clothes. The clothes that you put in the bins should be used less frequently than the clothes you hang up, or they should be clothes that don't need to be hung up, like your workout clothes. Here are a few ideas: Don't waste the space under your hanging clothes. Put a few plastic bins of clothes under the hanging clothing. If you have room for a dresser, consider putting one in your closet. It will save you time and space. Consider installing a closet organizer to find a more efficient way to store your remaining clothes . If you have overhead space, make the most of it. Use it to store bulky sweaters, sweats, and other items that are thick and easy to spot. 8. Organize your shoes. Your shoes may take up a lot of the space in your closet, so once you've chosen which shoes you will keep, it's important to make the most of your space by storing them in the most organized and efficient manner. Here are some ways to organize the shoes in your closet: Organize them by type. Separate your dress shoes, sandals, and boots. Organize them by how often you wear them. Keep your favorite pair of boots, flip-flops, or sneakers in the place with the easiest access. Invest in a shoe rack to place on the floor of your closet. This will make it much easier to find the pair of shoes you want. Try storing your shoes in your overhead space. This is another easy way to save space. If your closet has a door that opens instead of a sliding door, consider getting a hanging shoe rack. If you have a front hall closet, consider putting the shoes you wear the most often there instead to save space in your personal closet. 9. Organize any boxes in your closet. If your closet is big enough, then it's likely that you've stored things other than clothes in it, such as big boxes filled with mementos, old photo albums, and CDs you haven't seen for ten years. To finish organizing your closet, you should go through these old boxes to see what you should keep and what you should toss. Here's how to do it: Get rid of any papers or items you've kept for over a year that have no sentimental value. Consolidate the boxes to save closet space. If your closet is already cramped, consider putting some of the items in a different place, such as putting your old high school yearbooks on the bottom of your bookshelf. If you've been using cardboard boxes, trade them up for plastic bins. They will last longer and will be more visually appealing. Label the boxes or bins so you know what's in them next time you move or organize your things again. 10. Organize any additional items in your closet. Take the time to go through any additional items in your closet to make sure that you still need them and that the closet is really the best place for them. Here are some examples: If you find any towels, sheets, or blankets, put them in your linen closet. If you've had an old lawn chair or another piece of furniture you don't really need hanging out back there, it's time to throw it out. If you've had to pick up an item and spend at least fifteen seconds trying to figure out what the heck it is or why you would need it, it's time to throw it out. Make sure that all of the other items you find belong in the closet and not another part of your home. For example, if you find a box of light bulbs, a box of comic books, or a box of chocolate, ask yourself if those items wouldn't be more logically organized elsewhere. 11. Make your closet more visually appealing. Turn your creativity loose and think of ways to add pleasure to the routine of getting dressed and looking through your closet every day. If you spend more time making your closet look nice, then you will be less likely to let it get messy in the future. Paint your closet a soft pretty color. Add mirrors for sparkle. Hang jewelry and scarves where you can see them -- as long as they don't get in your way. Hang up a small poster or painting that makes you smile every time you open your closet. 12. Enjoy your newly organized closet. Take a step back and admire your hard work! Hopefully, your closet is organized now so that all of its contents are easy to find and its overall appearance is to your liking. If not, take a few more minutes to make any minor changes that still need to be made. From this point forward, try to keep your closet organized as you add to it, or remove and return its current contents. Doing so will prevent you from needing to do another large overhaul on your closet in the future.",

    "reference_text": "1. Rinse your board right after using it. Rinse your board with water right after you use it, rather than waiting until the end of the meal or even the next day when you clean it. This will help minimize bacteria growth and keep your board cleaner. Resist the urge to throw your board in the sink after the meal and forget about it. 2. Clean your board with dish soap and hot water. To clean your cutting board, scrub it with a few drops of dish soap on a sponge and some hot water. [2] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview Be sure to remove any food particles as you wash, paying particular attention to any grooves or scrapes in your board. Food can collect in these spots. Never clean a wooden cutting board in the dishwasher or soak it in water. The wood will absorb water, which can lead to bacteria and mold forming. [4] X Expert Source James Sears House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview 3. Rinse your board. Rinse your board to remove any traces of soap. You don’t want whatever you cook next to taste like your dish soap. [5] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview 4. Dry your board thoroughly to prevent cracking. After you’re finished washing your cutting board, dry it thoroughly with a clean dishtowel, removing any excess water. This is particularly important if your board is made of wood, as they are more prone to cracks. 5. Use a combination of white vinegar and baking soda. To sanitize your cutting board after use, sprinkle it with some baking soda. Then, spray the baking soda–covered board with white vinegar. This will fizz, helping draw stains out of your board and deodorizing it. Let this mix sit for 5 minutes and then rinse your board with water, drying as normal. 6. Disinfect your board with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Just as hydrogen peroxide can clean a wound, it can also clean your cutting board. Sprinkle your board with 3% hydrogen peroxide solution, and let it stand for 1 minute to kill any surface bacteria. Then, rinse your board with water, and dry with a dishtowel as normal. [8] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview Hydrogen peroxide can bleach porous surfaces like wood. Don’t let the solution sit too long or it might fade your cutting board. 7. Remove stains with a scrub of coarse salt. For deep, set-in stains on your cutting board, use a coarse salt, such as kosher salt, as a scrub. [10] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview Wet a sponge and use a handful of salt to scour your board, focusing on any areas of discoloration. Rinse your board with water when finished, and dry with a clean towel. [11] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview Be sure to wash your hands well and moisturize them with lotion after scrubbing your board with salt. It can be very drying. Another option is wearing kitchen gloves. 8. Wash your board with diluted bleach once a month. Especially if you work with raw meats and fish on your cutting board, use a diluted bleach solution to do a deep clean of your board once a month. Make a solution that’s 1/8th bleach and 7/8ths water. Wet a sponge, and scrub your board with the solution. Rinse well with plain water and dry your board as normal with a clean towel. 9. Rub your board with a lemon to deodorize once a week. To keep your board smelling fresh, use half of a cut lemon to deodorize your board. Rub the cut-side of the lemon along the length of the board side to side. Then, rinse with plain water, and dry with a clean towel. 10. Condition your cutting board weekly. If your cutting board is made of wood, use mineral oil to condition your board after it’s clean. This will keep it in optimal condition. Do not use organic oils or fats, which can turn rancid, to lubricate your board. Look for products labeled kitchen-grade white mineral oil, such as Howard’s Cutting Board Oil. There are other mineral oils meant for lubricating machinery but not for consumption. Look specifically for kitchen-grade oil. You can condition your board every time you clean it, or a minimum of once a week. Simply rub your board with the conditioner, and let it air try so the oil can soak in.",

Place a damp towel under the board so it won’t slip.\n\n2. **Remove crown & base**\n\n* Lay the pineapple on its side. Slice off about ½ inch from the top (crown) and bottom to make flat ends.\n\n3. **Stand and peel**\n\n* Stand it upright. Following the curve of the fruit, slice downward in long strips to remove the skin. Keep cuts shallow to save fruit.\n\n4. **Remove the “eyes”**\n\n* You’ll see brown “eyes” left in diagonal rows. Make shallow V-shaped notches along those diagonals (or shave them off) until the flesh is clean.\n\n5. **Choose your cut**\n\n* **Method A — Rings:** Lay the pineapple on its side and slice crosswise into ½-inch discs. Use a small round cutter or a paring knife to remove the hard core circle from each disc.\n* **Method B — Spears & Chunks:** Stand it up. Cut in half lengthwise, then into quarters. Lay each quarter flat and slice off the tough core (a pale, fibrous triangle) from the center edge. Cut quarters into long spears, then into bite-size chunks.\n\n6. **Serve or store**\n\n* Eat right away, or refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 3–4 days. For longer storage, freeze chunks on a tray, then bag.\n\n**Tips**\n\n* A ripe pineapple smells sweet at the base and yields slightly when pressed.\n* For cleaner cuts, wipe juice from the board as you go.\n* Try a sprinkle of lime and chili powder, or grill spears 1–2 minutes per side for caramelization.\n\n(Visual guide generated separately above.)\n",

    "question": "How to wash your face properly? Provide illustrated steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. A mild cleanser cleans skin gently without irritation. No matter what skin type you have, for daily cleansing, pick a face wash that’s fragrance- and alcohol-free. Using cleansers that are too harsh can strip your skin of its natural oils, leading to breakouts and dry skin. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source First, figure out what skin type you have , then check out our cleanser recommendations below: For oily or acne-prone skin: Oil-free cleanser (that won’t clog pores) [2] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source For dry skin: Hydrating cleanser (to moisturize while you wash) For combination or normal skin: Gentle foaming cleanser (to cleanse dirt and grime gently) For sensitive skin: Fragrance-free cleanser (to avoid irritating skin) For aging skin: Gentle cleanser (to cleanse dirt and grime without drying) 2. Take off your makeup to avoid clogged pores. Face cleansers are meant to cleanse your skin, not remove makeup. If you like to wear makeup during the day, use a gentle makeup remover on a cotton pad to take everything off before washing your face. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you have acne-prone or oily skin, go for a water-based makeup remover (instead of an oil-based one) to avoid clogged pores. 3. Use lukewarm water to gently wet your skin. Hot water strips your skin of its natural oils, and cold water doesn’t remove dirt and grime effectively. Turn your tap to a temperature that’s just above room temp, then splash your face with water. If you have long hair, pull it back into a bun or ponytail before you start washing your face. This will make it much easier to cleanse your skin. 4. Gently apply face wash to your skin in a circular motion. Pour a coin-sized amount of cleanser onto your hands, then rub your palms together to lather it up. Rub the cleanser all over your face, including your cheeks, nose, forehead, chin, and jawline for about 10 seconds. Using a washcloth or a cleansing device to wash your face might sound like a good idea, but actually, they can be too harsh on your skin. For daily cleansing, just use your hands. Don’t use cleanser around your eyes. The skin there is so delicate that it rarely needs cleansing—just splashing the area with water will do. 5. Be gentle with your skin as you rinse and dry to avoid irritation. Use lukewarm water again, and splash it onto your face to rinse off the cleanser. Grab a clean towel and pat your skin dry, trying not to rub or scrub your face. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Rubbing your skin with a towel can be irritating, which can lead to dry skin or acne breakouts. Be sure to dry your skin with a clean towel. Using a dirty towel can introduce bacteria into your skin, which can lead to clogged pores. 6. Use toner to tackle red marks or dark spots. Using a toner is totally optional, and not everyone needs one in their skincare routine. However, using a toner can help smooth out your skin tone and complexion. To add a toner to your skincare routine, pour a pea-sized amount onto a cotton swab and gently rub it into your skin right after cleansing. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For oily or acne-prone skin: Cleansing toner (to prevent breakouts) For dry skin: Hydrating toner (to moisturize throughout the day) For combination or normal skin: Toner with witch hazel and aloe (to smooth skin and close the pores) For sensitive skin: Soothing toner (for hydration without irritation) For aging skin: Toner with vitamin C (to hydrate and plump skin) If you use serums, acne cream, or other products on your skin, now is the time to apply those as well. 7. Apply moisturizer to lock in hydration after cleansing. Washing your face is very drying, and all skin types need some moisture afterward. Find a moisturizer that’s for your skin type, then rub moisturizer all over your skin with your fingertips. [8] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source For oily or acne-prone skin: Hydrating gel [9] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source For dry skin: Thick salve or ointment For combination or normal skin: Moisturizing lotion For sensitive skin: Fragrance-free moisturizer For aging skin: Cream-based moisturizer [10] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source 8. Cleanse your skin in the morning and at night to keep it clean. Experts recommend washing your face 2 times per day, or after you sweat. This will help keep your skin clean and avoid oil-buildup and breakouts. [11] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Overwashing your face can be just as damaging as not washing it enough. Although it might seem like a good idea to cleanse your skin more often throughout the day, your face needs its natural oils to function. Try to stick to washing once in the morning and once at night for the best results. If you feel like your skin needs a refresh during the day, splash it with lukewarm water and then pat your face dry. This will help wipe away any excess oil or grime on your skin. Don’t feel like you need to include a whole slew of products in order to have a great routine. Try adding in products one at a time to figure out what works best for you! Reader Poll: We asked 871 wikiHow readers about what products make up their daily skincare routine, and 56% of them shared that they use just water and maybe one product . [Take Poll] 9. Exfoliating removes dead skin cells and opens up your pores. Over-exfoliating can be drying and can lead to breakouts, so try to exfoliate instead of washing your face no more than once a week. To exfoliate, wet your skin with lukewarm water, then gently rub a chemical exfoliant or a physical exfoliant onto your skin. Rinse your skin with lukewarm water, pat it dry, then follow up with a moisturizer. [12] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Chemical exfoliants are better for dry or sensitive skin, and physical exfoliants are better for normal or oily skin. Exfoliating is very drying, so always follow up with a moisturizer afterwards. 10. Use sunscreen to prevent dark marks and hyperpigmentation. An important part of your skin care routine is using SPF 30 or higher sunscreen every day. Apply it after your moisturizer and before your makeup (if you wear it) to protect against UV rays when you head outside. Make sure to reapply your sunscreen every 2 hours, or as often as the bottle tells you to. If you have oily skin, look for an oil-free sunscreen to avoid clogged pores or breakouts. For all other skin types, look for a sunscreen that’s formulated for your face. Remember, UV rays are always there, even on cloudy days! Sunscreen will protect your skin even when you can’t see the sun.",

Hold one end of the rope in your left hand. This will be your ‘standing end’ or the end that does not move (consider this end the ‘hole’ and the ‘tree’.) Hold the other end in your right hand (this is the free end--the end of the rope that will be used to form the knot, or the ‘rabbit.’)Make a small loop with the end of the string in your left hand.

    "question": "How to clean a coffee maker? Provide illustrated steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Disassemble the coffee maker. Remove any parts that come off, such as the pot, the brew basket, and any other removable parts. These part should be cleaned separately from the rest of the coffee maker. 2. Wash the removable parts. Submerge the removable parts in warm, soapy water, and wash them using a dish rag. You can wash removable parts of your coffee maker the same way you would wash dishes. Glass pots can be very breakable. When washing your coffee maker's pot, treat the glass gingerly. Some coffee makers may have parts that can be washed in a dishwasher. Check the instructions manual, if you still have it. If you're unsure if your coffee maker can be washed in the dishwasher, err on the side of caution and hand wash it. 3. Wipe down the outside of the machine. Take a wet, soapy rag and give the outside of the machine a good wipe down. Wipe down the sides and remove any coffee grinds from the warming plate. When you're down, wipe off any soap suds with a clean, damp rag. 4. Reassemble your machine. After all the parts are dry, you can put your coffee machine back together. It is ready to use again. Make a habit of cleaning your coffee maker like this after each use. 5. Add a vinegar and water solution to your coffee maker. [4] X Expert Source Jonathan Tavarez Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview Make a mixture using 2 parts warm water and 1 part white vinegar. [5] X Expert Source Marcus Shields House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview The precise amounts will vary depending on the size of your coffee maker, but make roughly enough to fill the reservoir. Pour the mixture into the reservoir like you normally would with water when making coffee. 6. Let the coffee machine run half a brew cycle. [7] X Expert Source Jonathan Tavarez Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview Turn the coffee machine on. Keep an eye on it as it brews. Once about half the pot is full with the filtered vinegar/water mixture, turn the pot off. 7. Let the coffee maker sit for an hour. Set a timer for an hour. Let the coffee pot sit for this time frame. This will give the vinegar time to sit in the machine and clean out any mold. 8. Complete the brew cycle. After letting the coffee maker sit for an hour, turn the machine back on. Let it run the rest of the brew cycle. [10] X Expert Source Jonathan Tavarez Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview When done, all the vinegar/water mixture should be filtered into the pot. You can pour this mixture down the sink. 9. Run three brew cycles with plain water. Fill your coffee pot with clean water. Pour this into the reservoir and run a complete brew cycle. [12] X Expert Source Jonathan Tavarez Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview When it's done, pour the water out and run two more brew cycles with clean water. This should clean any vinegar out of your coffee maker. 10. Wipe down the coffee maker. After disinfecting the coffee maker, take a clean, damp rag. Wipe down the exterior of the machine to remove any dirt and debris. You should also make sure to remove coffee grinds from the warming plate. 11. Read your instruction's manual. If you still have the instructions manual, read it before cleaning your coffee maker. Most coffee makers can safely be cleaned with a vinegar/water mixture, but it's always a good idea to check first. [15] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source If you don't have the instructions manual, try looking up your model online. You may be able to find an instructions manual on the Internet. 12. Leave the reservoir lid open. Many people keep the reservoir lid closed. However, it's a good idea to leave it open when not in use. This will help dry out the machine, preventing mold and bacteria from growing in a moist environment. 13. Rinse the brew basket in the sink regularly. The brew basket is very susceptible to mold as it gets wet during the brewing process. Make sure you rinse out the brew basket after each use and make a habit of cleaning it each time you do dishes. This will keep your coffee maker mold and germ free.

Discard grounds and the paper filter.\n2. Wash the carafe, brew basket, lid, and reusable mesh filter in warm, soapy water; rinse and air-dry.\n3. Wipe the exterior and warming plate with a damp cloth; leave the lid open to dry.\n\n## Deep clean & descale (every 1–3 months, or ~every 40 brews)\n\n1. **Empty & prep:** Reassemble the empty basket; place the empty carafe on the plate.\n2. **Mix descaler:**\n\n   * Option A: Fill the reservoir with a **1:1 mix of white vinegar and water**.\n   * Option B (vinegar-free): **1–2 tsp citric acid per cup (250 mL) of warm water**, stir to dissolve, then fill the reservoir.\n3. **Start brew & soak:** Run a brew cycle until the carafe is **about halfway** full, then **pause** the machine for **30 minutes** to dissolve mineral buildup.\n4. **Finish brew:** Resume and complete the cycle; discard the hot solution carefully.\n5. **Rinse cycles:** Fill the reservoir with plain water and run **2–3 full cycles**, discarding each carafe, until there’s **no vinegar/citric smell**.\n6. **Detail clean:**\n\n   * Wipe the showerhead/spray arm and the area under the brew basket; use a soft brush or toothpick to clear clogged holes.\n   * Clean the carafe stains with a paste of **baking soda + a few drops of water**; rinse thoroughly.\n7. **Reinstall filter:** If you use a charcoal water filter, install a fresh one.\n\n## Safety & tips\n\n* **Never use bleach** or abrasive scrubbers inside the machine.\n* Hard water? Descale **monthly**; soft water can go **every 2–3 months**.\n* For **single-serve pod machines**, run a “brew” with no pod using the same descaling mix, then 2–3 water-only brews; also clean the pod needle with the manufacturer’s tool or a paperclip.\n\nIf you’d like, I can also generate a second illustration specifically for single-serve machines or espresso makers.\n",

    "question": "How to connect a Wi-Fi network on a laptop? Provide a visual guide and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Get a wireless router. Most ISPs will supply you with both a Wi-Fi router and modem, or a Wi-Fi router/modem combo. If your ISP only provides a modem, or you don't want to rent a Wi-Fi router from them, you can buy your own. Various factors will determine which router is best for you, including speed, bandwidth capabilities, and Wi-Fi coverage/distance. Speed These days, all wireless routers (even the budget models) are pretty fast. If you need ultra-fast Wi-Fi speeds—perhaps multiple devices will be streaming movies in 4k or 8k, gaming, or sharing large amounts of data at the same time—opt for a router with Wi-Fi 7 technology . If you're on a budget and want blazingly fast but don't need extreme , opt for a Wi-Fi 6 router . Distance If you have a very large home, consider a mesh router system instead of a standalone Wi-Fi router. Mesh Wi-Fi systems consist of a router with a series of nodes to expand the coverage in all areas of your home. 2.4GHz or 5Ghz 2.4 GHz covers a wider distance, is supported by more devices, and is good at penetrating walls and large furniture. However, it's more prone to interference because more devices (including cordless phones) use this frequency. 5 GHz is faster and less prone to interference, but it does have a smaller coverage area and cannot penetrate solid objects as well as 2.4GHz. Security The highest level of security is WPA3, but some devices (including Nintendo Switch) don't support it. Choose a router that has a WPA2/WPA3 Transitional mode, which allows newer devices to use WPA3 and older devices to use WPA2. 2. Connect the modem to the appropriate port on your wall. If you have a separate modem, connect it to the DSL, cable, or fiber port on your wall using the cable provided to you by your ISP, and turn the unit on. If the modem and router are one unit, connect that to the wall port, and turn the unit on. 3. Connect the router to your modem and turn it on. If the router is separate from the modem, you'll need to connect it to the modem using an ethernet cable. Plug one end of the cable into the port on the back of the router labeled WAN/WLAN/Internet or similar, and the other end into the modem's LAN port. 4. Place your router. For the best possible signal , position the wireless router in a central location, away from walls and metal objects, and not on the floor. [3] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source Any obstacles will degrade the signal. Remember that it must be physically connected to your modem, so this may limit your options when placing the router. 5. Connect your computer or phone to the router. Some routers have a mobile app you can install that makes Wi-Fi setup a breeze—check your router's documentation to see if you can download an app and use it to set up your router. If not, you'll need to connect your computer to the router using an ethernet cable to set up your wireless network. 6. Log in to the router's admin page. If you connected your computer via ethernet, you'll need to open the router's configuration page and sign in with the admin password. Open a web browser and enter the router's web address. According to Showers, the IP address is typically https://192.168.1.1, https://192.168.0.1, or https://10.0.0.1, but can vary based on the router model. [4] X Expert Source Tyrone Showers Technologist Expert Interview Consult the documentation that came with the router to find the exact address. The router will ask you for a login name and password, or sometimes just a password. The password you'll need to use is in your router's documentation or sometimes printed on a sticker on the back of the router. If you bought a used router, you can find the default admin password for most routers at https://portforward.com/router-password . 7. Enter your internet connection information. In most cases, your router should obtain this information automatically from your modem. If it doesn't, you may need to enter some information about your internet connection—often a username and password and DNS server addresses. If you're not sure what to enter, contact your ISP. 8. Set up your Wi-Fi access point. Locate the Wireless or Wi-Fi section of your router's configuration page. You can enable Wi-Fi, change the network name, and set the security level here. The \"SSID\" field is where you'll enter a name for your Wi-Fi router. This is the name people will see when they want to connect to the internet. If you live in an area with a lot of public traffic, avoid putting any identifiable information in the SSID, as anyone with a wireless device can see it. Make sure to set the security/encryption to the latest version allowed by your router. This will most likely be WPA3 (best) or WPA2 (less good, but more compatible with older devices). Create a password for your Wi-Fi network. While this is not required, Showers recommends it. \"Creating a strong password, combining letters, numbers, and special characters is important to enhance security,\" he says. [5] X Expert Source Tyrone Showers Technologist Expert Interview 9. Apply your settings. Make sure you click the Apply or Save Changes button in your router's configuration when you are done changing the settings. The router will process for a moment (or reboot), and your new settings will take effect. 10. Connect your devices to Wi-Fi. Once the router is online, you can connect your Wi-Fi capable devices so they can access the internet. Android Swipe down from the top of the screen. Tap and hold the Wi-Fi icon to open your Wi-Fi settings. Slide the \"Wi-Fi\" switch to \"ON\" (or tap the option to Use Wi-Fi ). Select your Wi-Fi network name. iPhone or iPad Open Settings .

Short cross-members link the pair of spirals at regular intervals—just like DNA’s “base pairs”—and lighting emphasizes the twist so the pattern reads clearly, especially at night.\n\nIt can still carry crowds safely because that DNA form isn’t just decoration; it’s a working spatial truss. Here’s how it holds up the deck:\n\n* Two opposite helices share the load. One spiral primarily takes compression in some segments while the other takes tension; together they brace each other against buckling and twisting.\n* Radial struts connect the deck to the helices, so the walkway’s weight (and people on it) is transferred into the surrounding tube network rather than a single beam.\n* The helical tubes form closed, triangulated paths for forces, which is very efficient. Loads flow through the tubes to a series of piers in the bay, so the bridge is supported in stages rather than by one long, bending span.\n* Stainless-steel tubes provide high strength relative to weight and resist corrosion in the marine environment, keeping the structure stiff and durable.\n* The geometry also resists side winds and footfall vibrations, and the deck has full-height guardrails and non-slip surfacing for safety.\n\nIn short: the bridge reads as DNA because its load-bearing skeleton is a pair of intertwined steel helices with “rungs”—the same elements that make it strong enough for pedestrians.\n\n(Generated photo provided above.)\n",

In short: it’s designed to be safe.\n\n* **Engineered for passengers:** The Eye is a giant observation wheel with a robust steel structure and tensioned cable “spokes” for strength and stability.\n* **Stabilized, enclosed capsules:** Riders travel in sealed, climate-controlled pods that keep the floor level as the wheel turns, protecting people from wind and motion.\n* **Slow, controlled operation:** The wheel rotates at a gentle, steady pace so boarding and disembarking are calm and orderly, with operators able to pause movement when needed.\n* **Redundant safety systems:** Multiple drive, brake, and power safeguards — plus constant monitoring — allow controlled stops and safe operation even if something needs attention.\n* **Professional staffing & procedures:** Trained operators manage queues, boarding gates, and emergency protocols, including weather limits and evacuation plans.\n* **Strict inspections & compliance:** Like other major rides in the UK, it undergoes routine inspections and maintenance and must comply with stringent health-and-safety regulations before carrying the public.\n\nIf you’d like a version of the photo with a different angle (nighttime, close-up capsule, or skyline view), say the word and I’ll generate it.\n",

    "generated_text": "Here’s the explanation (text), separate from the image above:\n\nCars can drive through the Chandelier Tree because a man-made tunnel was carved through the base of this very large coast redwood decades ago as a roadside attraction. The opening removes only a central portion of the trunk, leaving thick “legs” of wood on both sides. Like a stone arch, those side walls carry most of the compressive load down to the roots, so the trunk can still support itself.\n\nBiologically, coast redwoods are unusually resilient: most water and nutrient transport happens in a thin, living layer just under the bark (the cambium and outer sapwood). Even though the tunnel removes wood and bark at the opening, continuous living tissue remains around the sides and back of the trunk, so flow up and down the tree can continue. Redwood heartwood is rot-resistant and the species can compartmentalize wounds, helping the tree survive long term.\n\nTo protect it, the attraction limits traffic to small vehicles, one at a time and at very low speed, minimizing vibration and impact. Modern arborists would not create new “drive-through” trees today, but this one remains as a historic curiosity—surviving thanks to the combination of clever arch-like shaping and the redwood’s natural toughness.\n",

The public route—marketed as “Up at The O2”—is a purpose-built, slightly springy tensile walkway laid over the dome. Visitors step on this walkway, not on the delicate membrane roof.\n • Supported by the arena’s structural skeleton. The walkway is cable-hung and bracketed back to the O2’s primary structure (the steel perimeter ring, radial cables, and the iconic yellow masts). This means the loads from groups of people are carried by the steelwork and cables designed to handle them.\n • Non-slip, flexible deck. The deck uses a high-friction, weather-resistant surface with just enough give to accommodate the dome’s curvature and wind movements without damaging the underlying roof.\n • Continuous fall-arrest system. Each climber wears a harness clipped to a continuous safety rail along the route, with handlines and occasional steps at steeper sections—so people remain secured the entire time.\n • Controlled capacity and guided access. Group sizes, pacing, and weather checks are managed by guides, keeping live loads within the design limits and ensuring safe operation.\n\nIn short, a separate, engineered walkway—suspended and anchored to the O2’s main steel-and-cable frame—plus a clip-in safety system makes it possible for visitors to walk over the dome safely.",

If you don’t have an exercise mat, then lay out a soft towel or do crunches on a carpeted floor so you’re more comfortable. 2. Bend your knees so your feet are flat on the floor. Position your feet so your heels are about 12 to 18 in (30 to 46 cm) from your tailbone. Bend your knees to 90 degrees and keep them about hip-width apart. Make sure the soles of your feet are flat against the ground. 3. Cross your arms in front of your chest with your hands just below your shoulders. Keep your elbows pointed down toward your feet. Lay your hands flat on your chest right in front of your shoulders. Avoid putting your hands behind your head since you could accidentally strain your neck when you perform your exercise. For more resistance during your workout, hold a 5 to 10 pounds (2.3 to 4.5 kg) plate weight over your chest. 4. Lift your shoulder blades off of the mat with a smooth, controlled motion. Tighten your abs and take a deep breath in. As you exhale, engage your muscles to raise your torso off of the mat all while keeping your lower back and feet flat on the floor. Lift yourself just enough to get your shoulder blades off of the floor. Support yourself in this position for 1–2 seconds. Avoid sitting all the way up when you perform a crunch since muscles in your back and hips will take over, and you could strain yourself. Keep your lower back, tailbone, and feet in contact with the mat at all times. If your feet lift off of the ground while you’re performing a rep, have someone hold onto your feet or position them underneath something heavy. Keep your neck relaxed instead of tucking in your chin. Try to keep an apple-sized space between your chin and your chest. Looking at the ceiling can help keep you from curling your neck too much. 5. Lower yourself back down with a slow, steady motion. Gently inhale as you slowly lower your torso down to the floor. Use a smooth, controlled motion to work your ab muscles and prevent you from injuring yourself. Take a brief pause to finish 1 rep. If you rush into the next rep, you’ll end up using the momentum of your body moving instead of your muscles to lift yourself up. Additionally, you’re more likely to injure your back Try doing a set of 10–12 crunches to start working out your abs . As you start building up your core strength, try doing 2–3 sets or increasing the number of reps you do.",

Choose the right heels\n\n* Pick a stable pair: block heel or wedge, 2–3 in (5–7.5 cm), secure ankle strap, good fit.\n* Add non-slip sole grips if the bottoms are slick.\n\n2. Prep & warm up (1–2 min)\n\n* Ankle circles (both directions), calf raises, gentle hamstring/calf stretch.\n* Check straps/buckles are snug.\n\n3. Posture setup\n\n* Stand tall: ears over shoulders, shoulders over hips, ribs stacked, neutral pelvis.\n* Engage your core lightly; look where you’re going (not at your feet).\n\n4. Start with short, quick steps\n\n* Keep strides small to stay balanced.\n* Aim for a light, quick cadence rather than long reaches.\n\n5. Soft forefoot landing\n\n* Touch down gently near the ball of the foot, then roll through—avoid stabbing the heel first.\n* Keep toes pointing forward; don’t let ankles collapse inward.\n\n6. Use compact arm swing\n\n* Elbows ~90°, swing close to the body to counterbalance without twisting your torso.\n\n7. Pick safe surfaces\n\n* Prefer smooth, dry, even ground.\n* Avoid grates, cobblestones, grass, wet tile, and steep slopes.\n* If you must cross hazards, slow to a walk.\n\n8. Braking & turning\n\n* To slow: shorten steps, keep torso tall, don’t lean back.\n* For turns: take several tiny steps (no sharp pivots on a planted heel).\n\n9. Emergency stop & recovery\n\n* If you wobble: plant both feet shoulder-width, knees soft, lower your heels toward flat, then reset.\n* If a heel catches: stop, step back out, don’t yank forward.\n\n10. Cool down & care\n\n* Walk it off for 30–60 seconds, stretch calves/arches.\n* Inspect tips/heel caps; swap to flats if feet feel fatigued.\n\n### Practice Drills (build skill before full running)\n\n* March in place in heels (30–60s).\n* Walk–jog intervals: 10–20m jog, 20–30m walk; repeat 4–6x.\n* Figure-8 weaving around two cones/chairs to train controlled turns.\n\n### Safety Notes\n\n* Running in heels increases risk of ankle/knee injury—only do brief sprints when necessary.\n* Never run in very high, narrow stilettos or loose shoes.\n* Carry foldable flats as a backup.\n\nIf you’d like, I can generate alternate visuals (e.g., a printable poster or a horizontal storyboard) or tailor the steps to your specific heel height.\n",

    "question": "How to do a squat with a Squat Rack? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Start with a low weight. The most important thing with squats is to have the correct form, so you shouldn't attempt weighted squats until you can perform body weight squats with perfect form. Start with a low weight — maybe just using the bar (which weighs 45lbs) — and slowly build yourself up to heavier weights as your squat technique and muscle strength improves. 2. Position the bar correctly. Set up the squat rack so the bar is slightly below shoulder level. Position the safety bars so they are low enough to allow you to squat down fully with the bar on your shoulders. When you're ready, duck under the bar and grip it widely with your palms facing forward. Rest the bar across your upper back (not your neck). If this feels uncomfortable for you, try using a bar pad. 3. Squat using the same technique as the body weight squat. Place your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, with your toes pointing slightly outwards. Hinge your hips and push your butt backwards until your hamstrings are parallel with the floor. Keep your chest up, your shoulders back and your eyes looking straight ahead. Remember to keep your back straight — this is especially important when you are squatting with heavy weights. Push out of the squat with your heels and don't let your knees cave in towards the center. If this happens, you may need to reduce your weight. 4. Inhale on the way down, exhale on the way back up. Breathing deeply is very important when squatting heavy weights. If you hold your breath you can become dizzy, nauseous or even blackout. Take a deep breath in as you squat down and exhale powerfully as you rise up. Maintaining this breathing pattern will give you the energy you need to keep going. If you're pushing yourself to get another few repetitions, don't be afraid to pause between repetitions to take a couple of deep breaths.",

Set J-cups & safeties → 2) Load bar & collars → 3) Unrack & walkout → 4) Stance & brace → 5) Descend → 6) Bottom position & depth → 7) Drive up → 8) Re-rack, plus a “Common mistakes” box (knees caving, heels lifting, bar drifting forward, excessive arch/round).\n\n# Text steps (detailed)\n\n1. Rack setup\n\n* Set J-cups around mid-chest so the bar is ~1–2 in (2–5 cm) below shoulder height.\n* Set safety pins just below your expected bottom depth (they should catch the bar if you fail without touching it during good reps).\n\n2. Load & secure\n\n* Load plates evenly and add collars. Clear the area behind you.\n\n3. Bar position & grip\n\n* Walk under the bar. Place it across the upper traps (high-bar) or slightly lower on the rear delts (low-bar)—choose one and keep it consistent.\n* Hands just outside shoulder width, squeeze the bar, wrists neutral (not bent back), elbows angled down/back to lock the upper back.\n\n4. Stance & bracing\n\n* Step under the bar with feet under hips, stand tall to unrack.\n* Take 1–2 controlled steps back.\n* Set feet shoulder-width (give or take), toes turned out ~10–30°.\n* Big breath into your belly and sides, brace your core 360°, ribs stacked over pelvis.\n\n5. The descent\n\n* Keep the bar over your mid-foot.\n* Break at hips and knees together; let the knees track over your toes (not collapsing inward).\n* Maintain a neutral spine and steady gaze (chin tucked, eyes forward).\n\n6. Bottom position & depth\n\n* Aim for hip crease at or just below the top of the knee (or the deepest pain-free, controlled range you can maintain).\n* Shins roughly forward, whole foot glued to the floor, weight mid-foot to heel.\n\n7. The ascent\n\n* Drive the floor away, push up through mid-foot/heels.\n* Keep knees tracking over toes and chest tall; think “stand up with the bar” and “drive hips and chest together.”\n* Exhale through the sticking point or finish the rep, then reset your breath between reps.\n\n8. Re-rack safely\n\n* Step forward until both sides touch the uprights, then sit the bar straight down into the J-cups.\n* Don’t let go until you’re sure it’s seated.\n\n9. Safety & spotting tips\n\n* Warm up with the empty bar, then small jumps.\n* Shoes with firm, flat or lifting soles improve stability.\n* Use a spotter for heavy sets (they should follow your torso and assist only if the bar stalls).\n* If you must bail alone: drop to the safeties by sitting back/soft knees and letting the bar settle on the pins—then step forward out.\n\n10. Common mistakes to avoid\n\n* Knees caving in hard.\n* Heels lifting or rocking to toes.\n* Bar drifting forward of mid-foot.\n* Over-arching or rounding the back.\n* Rushing the walkout (take only 1–2 steps).\n\n11. Simple programming starter\n\n* 3–5 sets × 3–8 reps, leaving 1–3 reps in reserve. Rest 2–4 minutes.\n\nWant a version tailored to front squats or low-bar specifics?

    "question": "How to Hold a Ping Pong Paddle? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Fit the blade of the paddle in the space between your thumb and index finger. If you look at your hand you’ll see the “V” shape that your thumb and index finger form. Place the paddle in your hand and move it so that its inside right bottom edge rests in that “V”. 2. Wrap your middle, ring, and pinky fingers around the handle. These are the only fingers you use to hold the ping paddle handle with a shakehand grip. These fingers should look similar to how they look when you’re shaking someone’s hand. Try moving the paddle up and down in a hand-shaking motion to the feel for this grip. 3. Rest your index finger against the outside of the paddle. Again, think of shaking someone’s hand. Your index finger is usually pointed outwards instead of curled in. This will help stabilize the paddle when you swing. If it feels more comfortable, let the tip of your finger rest against the side edge. 4. Curl your thumb around the front of the handle if you want greater wrist flexibility. This is called a shallow shakehand grip, and it's probably the most natural grip for beginners. It’s great for high freedom of movement for the paddle, which will make returning the ball easier. While this grip is usually pretty natural feeling, if it doesn't feel right to you, that may be a sign to try something else. 5. Rest your thumb against the front face of the paddle if you want a firmer grip. While this deep shakehand grip limits wrist flexibility, it works well for precise shots that don’t need a lot of power. Holding your paddle this way will also make it easy to switch the paddle from side to side, so it's great for both forehand and backhand shots. You can always switch between this thumb position and wrapping your thumb around the handle to get the benefits of both! 6. Keep your grip loose. Of course you want to grip the paddle firmly enough so it doesn’t fly out of your hand when you play, but a person should still be able to grab the paddle from you with only slight resistance. A too-tight grip will limit wrist flexibility too much making it difficult to hit or spin the ball. The paddle should feel like a natural extension of your arm, moving as freely as you move your hand. 7. Hold the paddle so its edge is perpendicular to the ground. You’ll notice your wrist tilts slightly downward. While the angle of the paddle will shift as you play, you want your wrist to stay in this position. Avoid floppy wrists when you swing! This will lead to you mis-hitting the ball. You need your entire forearm to swing and if you move your wrists around too much they’ll get tired. 8. Rest the handle in the space between your thumb and index finger. See the “V” shape formed by your thumb and index finger. With the handle angled upwards, rest its edge inside that “V” the way you would a pen. 9. Grip the handle between your thumb and index finger. Form a loop around the handle. Imagine writing with the paddle like a pen or pencil, and try moving it around in a pen writing motion to get a feel for the grip. 10. Keep your remaining fingers relaxed if you want greater wrist flexibility. For the Chinese penhold grip, lightly grip the outside face of the paddle with the tips of your middle, ring, and pinky fingers. Keep your fingers in a relaxed position. Holding the paddle this way will give you a wide range of motion and make it easy to block and push the ball. This grip makes it hard to consistently use backhand topspin or the spinning of the ball using the outside part of the paddle. 11. Straighten your middle, ring, and pinky fingers for more powerful strokes. For the Korean/Japanese penhold grip, the edge of your middle finger should lightly grip the outside face of the paddle with your ring and pinky stacked on top of it. You want your fingers to be rigidly straight. Holding the paddle this way will let you easily return a ball when standing far away from the table. Straight fingers can restrict paddle blade movement, making it harder for you to switch the paddle angle to reach the ball. 12. Use the “V” grip for high power and ball spin. Hold the blade of the paddle between your index and middle finger, forming a “V” shape. Place your thumb where it feels most comfortable. This grip ideal for wide-angle shots. Keep in mind that isn’t as popular as the penhold or shakehand grip, so finding a coach that specializes in it can be hard. 13. Block effectively with the Seemiller grip. Wrap your fingers around the handle of the paddle and rest your index finger on its back face as close to the bottom edge as you can get it. Use your thumb to grip the paddle blade with your index finger from the other side. Since backhand wrist flexibility is limited for this style, you may want to make backhand shots using the forehand side of your paddle. 14. Achieve heavy topspin with the reverse penhold grip. Hold the paddle handle between your thumb and index finger and rest your remaining three fingers against the paddle's outside face, keeping them relaxed. Angle the paddle in your hand slightly up so you can use both sides of the paddle to hit the ball. This grip is very similar to other penhold grips. The difference comes down to the angle you hold paddle and your style of play, and it's not unusual to see this grip combined with the Chinese or Korean/Japanese penhold styles.",

Start neutral\n   Hold the handle like a handshake. Keep your wrist relaxed and the blade (paddle face) roughly vertical.\n\n2. Thumb & index placement\n   Rest your **thumb lightly on the forehand rubber** near the handle. Lay your **index finger across the backhand rubber**, roughly horizontal. They should form a soft “V” along the top of the handle bevel.\n\n3. Wrap the other fingers\n   Curl the remaining three fingers around the handle. Leave a small gap (about a fingertip) between your palm and the handle’s butt—no choking up, no palming the blade.\n\n4. Set pressure points\n   Apply gentle pressure mainly with **thumb and index**. Keep the other fingers loose so the wrist can move freely.\n\n5. Angle for strokes\n   For **forehands**, let the index side relax so the blade can close slightly. For **backhands**, add a touch more pressure with the thumb to open the blade. Adjust in millimeters, not inches.\n\n6. Quick checks\n   Blade makes ~90° with your forearm at rest; wrist feels free; you can wiggle the blade without it slipping.\n\n# Penhold grip (popular in East Asia)\n\n1. Pinch the neck\n   Pinch the front of the blade with **thumb and index** as if holding a pen. The “circle” they form sits just above the handle.\n\n2. Rear-finger support\n   Place the **other three fingers on the back** of the blade. Beginners usually “fan” them; some players “stack” the middle/ring fingers—both are fine.\n\n3. Keep space and softness\n   Leave space between palm and handle. Grip softly so the wrist is very mobile.\n\n4. Forehand feel\n   Most control comes from the thumb–index pinch. Keep the blade slightly closed for drives; open a touch for topspin.\n\n5. Backhand options\n   For traditional penhold, use the forehand side for many shots by rotating the wrist. For RPB (reverse penhold backhand), contact with the back side—keep those rear fingers relaxed to allow the flip.\n\n6. Quick checks\n   No squeezing; blade moves easily with wrist; contact points feel precise at the thumb/index.\n\n# Common mistakes to avoid\n\n* **Death grip** (too tight) → kills wrist speed and touch.\n* **Index finger too high** across the rubber → limits forehand.\n* **Thumb creeping up** onto the rubber → blocks backhand.\n* **Palming the blade** (covering rubber with the palm) → reduces spin and reach.\n\n# Fast reminders\n\n* Relax first, then add just enough firmness at contact.\n* Small pressure shifts (thumb ↔ index) fine-tune forehand/backhand angles.\n* Start with shakehand if you’re unsure; it’s the most versatile for beginners.\n\nIf you want, I can also generate a second image focused solely on **shakehand** or **penhold**, or make printable cue cards.\n",

    "question": "How to Juggle a Soccer Ball? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Hold the ball straight out in front of you so that it is at the height of your chest. Drop it and let it bounce. As the ball begins to descend after this bounce, kick it back up into the air. Try to kick it with your dominant foot hard enough that it reaches chest height. Try to kick the ball with your foot angled slightly upward. Make sure to kick the ball with your laces. Make sure that your laces are not double knotted at first. The ball may bounce off of your laces at a weird angle if your laces are tied in a large knot. If you deflate the soccer ball a little bit, you will reduce the intensity of its bounce. The ball will be easier to control and won’t go flying every time you miss a kick. Once you’ve mastered the technique of juggling, you should fully inflate your ball. Keep your ankle 'locked' so that it stays angled and strong. A wobbly ankle leads to a wobbly kick. 2. Keep your knees slightly bent. Doing this will help you have better control over the ball. Do not lock your knees. Keep the foot you are not kicking with (your controlling foot) flat and firmly planted on the ground. It is important to be balanced while juggling the ball. In between touches, it is risky but useful to try to re-balance yourself such that you can maintain control of how you hit the ball each time. Always try to stay balanced on your toes, ready to make quick movements. The biggest key to balancing is to keep your knees bent and your eyes on the ball. 3. Practice until you can easily and consistently catch the ball in front of your stomach. You should not have to lean or reach to catch the ball. Then do the same with your other foot. Keep in mind that juggling with your non-dominant foot will be harder. Keep at it! 4. Increase the number of times you let the ball bounce off your feet. Instead of catching the ball every time you kick it, kick it up into the air and as it falls, kick it up again rather than letting it bounce on the ground. Try to keep the ball under control. Focus on juggling with one foot until you feel confident, then switch to the other foot. Practice until you feel confident juggling with both feet. You can \"catch\" the ball on your foot with careful practice by cushioning the fall of the ball and holding it in place with your foot and shin.",

First touch (“pop”)\n\n* Drop the ball, let it bounce once.\n* Lift your dominant foot; toes slightly up, ankle locked.\n* Strike the bottom-center with your laces so it rises to about waist height.\n\n3. Catch & reset\n\n* After one pop, catch the ball with your hands.\n* Repeat until the touch feels consistent and the ball goes straight up.\n\n4. Two pops, same foot\n\n* Drop → bounce → pop → bounce → pop → catch.\n* Keep touches light, ball close to your body, tiny hop on your standing foot.\n\n5. Alternate feet with a bounce\n\n* Right foot pop, bounce, left foot pop, bounce, catch.\n* Keep the ball centered between your feet.\n\n6. Continuous (no bounce)\n\n* Pop with one foot and, before it drops too far, pop with the other.\n* Aim for knee-to-waist height; stay balanced with small, light hops.\n\n7. Add thighs\n\n* When the ball rises too high for your feet, cushion and lift with your thigh.\n* Keep knees level; hit the mid-thigh so the ball goes straight up.\n\n8. Mix surfaces & control\n\n* Combine feet and thighs in a rhythm (R foot → L foot → R thigh → L foot, etc.).\n* Keep your torso quiet, eyes on the lower half of the ball, ankle locked on every touch.\n\n9. Build consistency (mini goals)\n\n* 5 touches total → 10 → 20 without moving much from your spot.\n* Then try “weak foot only” sets.\n\n10. Quick fixes for common mistakes\n\n* Ball drifting forward: lean slightly over the ball; strike more under the center.\n* Spinning ball: hit with a firm, flat laces surface; avoid toe-poking.\n* Popping too high: relax and hit lighter; aim for consistent knee-to-waist height.\n* Chasing the ball: take smaller hops and keep it centered between your shoulders.\n\nWant a version that adds heading (forehead) or chest control next?",

For best results, try bending your knees to a 90-degree angle, then standing back up. [1] X Expert Source Dean Theriot Personal Trainer Expert Interview 2. Keep your knees behind your toes. This protects your knees and back and helps you achieve maximum results. When you move into a squat, bend your knees so that they move directly over your feet, without going further than your toes. [3] X Expert Source Dean Theriot Personal Trainer Expert Interview 3. Keep your feet shoulder-width apart. For a standard free squat, start by keeping your feet under your shoulders. This help to avoid stress on your knees. 4. Angle your feet for plié squats. A plié squat is a free squat done with a wide stance. For these, it is important to angle your feet out and to bend your knees so they move directly over your feet. Begin by doing these at only a half-range of motion, and work up to getting your knee bends to 90 degrees. 5. Stop at the bottom. After you build up some leg strength, you may begin to \"break 90,\" or allow your squat to deepen more than a 90-degree bend in your knees. However, it is important to stop when your thighs lightly come into contact with your calves. Going beyond this can place unnecessary stress on your knees.",

If anything hurts (sharp pain), stop and adjust range or seek a pro.\n\n## 1) Set Your Stance\n\n* Feet about shoulder-width apart (a little wider or narrower based on comfort).\n* Toes turned slightly out (≈5–20°) so knees can track over them.\n* Distribute weight through the whole foot (heel + big toe + little toe). Look ahead.\n\n## 2) Brace\n\n* Take a deep breath “360°” into your belly and sides.\n* Gently lock ribs down as if prepping for a cough; keep spine neutral.\n* Set shoulders down/back. Lightly squeeze glutes.\n\n## 3) Initiate: Hips Back, Knees Out\n\n* Start the squat by sending the hips slightly back, then let the knees bend.\n* Let knees track in line with the toes (don’t cave inward).\n* Reach your arms forward a bit for balance if helpful.\n\n## 4) Descend Under Control\n\n* Lower smoothly; keep chest proud and back neutral.\n* Keep heels flat; stay balanced over mid-foot.\n* Go as low as **your** mobility allows—aim for thighs parallel to the floor or lower without losing your brace.\n\n## 5) Check the Bottom Position\n\n* Knees track over toes; don’t collapse inward.\n* Weight balanced (not on toes only; heels stay down).\n* Avoid excessive pelvis tuck (“butt wink”). If it appears, stop just above that range.\n\n## 6) Drive Up\n\n* Push the floor away through mid-foot/heels.\n* Stand up by extending hips and knees together (no shooting hips up first).\n* Keep knees tracking over toes; exhale through the sticking point.\n\n## 7) Finish Tall\n\n* Stand tall with hips and knees fully extended.\n* Reset your breath/bracing before the next rep.\n\n---\n\n## Breathing Cue (Simple)\n\n* **Inhale & brace** before you descend → **exhale** as you drive up.\n* For heavier sets, you can hold a gentle brace until you pass the hardest point, then exhale.\n\n## Common Mistakes → Quick Fixes\n\n* **Heels lift:** Widen stance slightly; slow down; work ankle mobility; try a small heel lift (5–10 mm).\n* **Knees cave in:** Think “spread the floor” or “push knees toward pinky toes.”\n* **Back rounds:** Re-brace; keep chest proud; shorten depth slightly; include core work.\n* **Leaning too far forward:** Bring heels under hips; use counterbalance arms; keep gaze forward.\n* **Bouncing/relaxing at bottom:** Pause briefly; keep tension.\n\n## Regressions (Easier)\n\n* **Box/Chair Squat:** Tap a box/chair behind you for depth control.\n* **Supported Squat:** Hold a doorframe/TRX for assistance.\n* **Heel-elevated Squat:** Place thin plates under heels to ease ankle demand.\n\n## Helpful Progressions (Harder)\n\n* **Goblet Squat (light weight)** for counterbalance and torso position.\n* **Tempo Squat:** 3-sec lower, no bounce, smooth up.\n* **Pause Squat:** 1–2 sec hold at the bottom with tension.\n* **Split Squat / Pistol to Box** for single-leg control.\n\n## Suggested Sets & Reps\n\n* Beginners: **3 × 8–10 reps**, rest 60–90 s.\n* Warm-up: 5 min light cardio + 2–3 easy ramp-up sets.\n\n> Goal: Smooth, controlled reps with consistent depth and balance.

    "question": "How to Do a Layup in Basketball? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Dribble close to the basket with your right hand. Since you're doing a right-handed layup, angle your approach toward the right side of the basket. You want to get close enough to have easy access to the basket, but not so close that you end up directly under it. Layups are often taken off of a running dribble. Practice approaching the basket slowly at first, and increase your speed once you've got the footwork down. You can do a right-handed layup if you're starting near the center or right side of the basket. If you're approaching the basket from the left, you'll want to do a left-handed layup. 2. Step toward the basket with your right foot. When you're just a few feet from the basket, take a step toward it with our right foot. Use this step to gain distance and position yourself within easy shooting range. Dribble the ball one last time just outside your right foot. 3. Jump off of your left foot. As soon as your left foot lands, use it to jump in the direction of the basket. Your body should be moving toward the basket, but don't lean forward. Ideally, you'll be positioned close enough to the basket that you can jump straight up to take your shot. As you jump, bring the ball out of the dribble to your chest to prepare for the shot. 4. Shoot with your right arm as you lift your right leg. As you jump, imagine a string attached to your right arm and your right leg. Move them at the same time as you shoot, as though someone were pulling upward on the string. Your right knee should be bent and pointed toward the basket while your right arm moves up to shoot the ball. Arch your arm toward the basket. Shoot with your elbow slightly bent, so that your arm looks like the neck of a swan. When you're doing a layup, the shooting technique is slightly different from that of a regular shot. Instead of using your left hand to steady the ball, you want to shoot the ball using only your right hand. This gives you more reach, and since you're so close to the basket that it's difficult to miss the shot, you don't really need your left hand to steady the ball. As you shoot, slightly rotate your wrist inward to give the ball a little bit of spin, rather than snapping your wrist forward as you would for a regular shot. The gentle spin will keep it from hammering off the rim or backboard with too much force. 5. Aim for the sweet spot on the backboard. One of the reasons a layup is such a sure bet is because you can always use the backboard to help ease the shot into the basket. When you're doing a right-handed layup, the sweet spot is slightly above the top right corner of the small square in the center of the backboard. This spot absorbs the impact of the ball and drops it right down through the net. You'll get two points no matter how you make your shot, but it's better to aim for the backboard instead of trying to just tip the ball over the rim. The backboard allows more room for error, but if you hit the rim funny the ball will bounce right out. There's nothing worse than missing a wide-open layup when you have full access to the basket, so work on hitting that sweet spot every time. 6. Practice until your muscles remember the movement. The layup is a fundamental basketball move that will become second nature after you practice it enough. You should get to the point where your body remembers what to do and you don't have to think about which foot to put forward and which one to jump off: you just do it. Do layups as part of every basketball practice . As you practice, you'll start to get a good sense for how fast to approach the basket and from what distance to begin your layup footwork and launch into a jump. Work on doing layups while you're being defended or off of a long pass.",

    "reference_text": "1. Lie down on the floor. Lie down on a fitness mat. Lie with your back flat on the ground, legs together and knees bent. Keep in mind that this movement is not recommended for anyone who has ever had a back problem. This movement can be made easier by placing your hands and arms lower on your body (crossing arms in front of your chest) or harder, by placing your hands and arms past your head (arms extended above your head). 2. Turn your legs to one side. With your knees remaining bent, turn at your waist and bring both of your legs to one side of your body, down to the floor. Your legs should be lying on top of each other. As you bring your legs down to the floor, keep your shoulder blades and the upper part of your back flat on the floor. Your rib cage should be down and not flared out in this position. If you overextend, you risk straining your upper back. [4] X Expert Source Brendon Rearick Personal Trainer & Strength Coach Expert Interview 3. Crunch to your side. Place your hands behind or at the sides of your head. Flex your abdominal muscles, and lift your shoulders off the floor. Be sure to keep your shoulders straight and level just as you would for a normal crunch. Hold the position for a moment, then release your constricted abdominal muscles to slowly bring your shoulders back down to the mat. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Do not pull at your head and neck to complete the crunch. Your hands are merely resting near your head as you contract your abdominal muscles to lift yourself up and crunch. [7] X Expert Source Brendon Rearick Personal Trainer & Strength Coach Expert Interview Exhale as you crunch and inhale as you return to your starting position. Then, repeat. Breathing properly will put your diaphragm in a better position for abdominal work. [8] X Expert Source Brendon Rearick Personal Trainer & Strength Coach Expert Interview 4. Complete your crunches on the other side of your body. Once you have completed one set of crunches on one side of your body (about 10–15 reps), turn your legs over to do the crunches on other side of your body. It’s recommended to do this exercise 1–3 sets on each side, 2–3 times a week.",

Set up\n\n* Lie on your **right side** on a mat.\n* Bend knees about **90°** and stack hips, knees, and ankles.\n* Right forearm on the floor for balance; **left hand** lightly behind your head (don’t pull your neck).\n* Keep ribs “down” and neck neutral.\n\n2.

Crunch up\n\n* **Exhale** and bring your **left ribcage toward your left hip**.\n* Lift both shoulders a few inches; keep elbow wide and gaze forward.\n* Knees and legs stay quiet—movement comes from your **obliques**, not from tugging the head.\n\n4. Pause\n\n* Hold the top position for **1 second**, keep breathing softly, feel the side squeeze.\n\n5. Lower with control\n\n* **Inhale** and lower your shoulders back to the start without collapsing. Maintain tension.\n\n6. Repeat & switch sides\n\n* Do **8–15 controlled reps**, then **flip to your left side** to work the right obliques.\n* Aim for **2–3 sets per side**.\n\n### Form tips & common mistakes\n\n* Keep hips stacked; don’t roll backward.\n* Don’t yank on your head—your hand just supports.\n* Small range is fine; prioritize **slow, controlled** reps.\n* If you feel your neck more than your side, reduce range and press your tongue lightly to the roof of your mouth to help stabilize.\n\n### Make it easier\n\n* Place top hand across your chest instead of behind your head.\n* Keep bottom arm straight and use it lightly on the floor for balance.\n\n### Make it harder\n\n* Straighten your legs and keep feet slightly off the floor.\n* Add a light dumbbell or small plate held against the side of your ribcage (still no neck pulling).\n\nIf you want variations (e.g., **side plank crunch** or **standing side crunch**), say the word and I’ll add those too.\n",

    "question": "How to Catch a Baseball? Show visual steps and text the steps.",
    "reference_text": "1. Get the right glove. Your glove becomes an extension of your hand when catching a baseball. It must fit your hand properly to work efficiently. As a general rule of thumb, players under the age of 12 will use a glove in the 10–11 inch (25.4–27.9 cm) range. Older players will use something between 11 and 13 inch glove. Before playing regularly with your glove, it’s important to beak in your glove. One of the best ways to break in your glove is by practicing your catch. [1] X Expert Source Isaac Hess Baseball Coach & Instructor Expert Interview 2. Position your body. Catching a baseball relies heavily on your stance and body position. You should be in the athletic position to prepare catching a ball. The athletic position takes the following into effect: Bend your knees slightly. This will give you the flexibility to lung for the ball and keep your mind focused. Keep your shoulders positioned towards the target. This will make it easier to visualize and react once the ball comes towards you. Stand on the balls of your feet instead of standing flat-footed. 3. Watch the ball. The key to catching a baseball is to never let the ball out of your sight. Keep your eyes fixed from the time the ball leaves the thrower's hand until it lands in your glove. By watching the ball, you can track the ball’s flight plan, and prepare for the right stance to catch the ball. ”You can’t catch what you can’t see,” meaning it'll be difficult to catch the ball if your eye is off the ball. 4. Go to the ball. Don’t feel inclined to stay anchored in one place, but instead move to catch the ball. If the ball is thrown and you can tell it will land behind you, run backwards while watching the ball. In baseball, catchers play by zone defense. When the ball enters your zone, it’s your job to move to it. 5. Position your glove. Hold your glove with your palm facing outwards in front of your body. Position the glove in the direction of the target who is throwing the ball. If the ball is thrown above your belly button, you can use this stance to catch the ball with little adjustment. If the throw is below your belly button, rotate your glove so that your fingers are pointed down. When the ball is thrown above your body, use the first position mentioned, but extend your arm upwards. 6. Catch the baseball. Catch the ball in the pocket of the glove. The pocket is another name for the palm of the glove. Close your hand immediately once the ball makes contact with your glove. Get into the practice of using your second hand to secure the catch. Using your second hand will also prepare you to throw once you become a catcher. Your free hand needs to have quick access to the ball. 7. Keep your vision clear. Be careful not to obstruct your vision with your glove when going for the catch. If a ball is heading towards your face, move your glove to the position at the last second. This might take some practice, but the goal is to watch the ball till the final second. Practice throwing with a friend to avoid a black eye on game day. You can usually reposition yourself to avoid your face crossing the ball’s flight path.",

Funnel to your chest\n   • Bring the glove to the center of your body to secure it and prepare a throw or tag.\n\n7. Communicate & position\n   • For fly balls say “Mine!” and take priority if you have the easier angle. Avoid backpedaling—turn and run to the spot, then get set.\n\n8. Bare-hand (only on soft tosses/foul balls in the stands)\n   • Keep fingers together, elbows slightly bent, and **give** with the ball. Avoid trying to bare-hand hard line drives.\n\n9.

When tectonic forces push, pull, or shear the crust, stress builds along the fault.\n\nHow faults cause earthquakes (the stick-slip cycle):\n1.\tLocked: Rough fault surfaces “stick” due to friction while plate motion keeps stressing them.\n2.\tStrain builds: Rock around the fault elastically bends and stores energy.\n3.\tRupture: When stress exceeds frictional strength, the fault suddenly slips. The break starts at the hypocenter (focus) at depth and spreads along the fault.\n4.\tSeismic waves: Stored elastic energy radiates as P and S waves that shake the ground. The point on the surface above the focus is the epicenter.\n5.\tAftershocks: The crust adjusts to the new positions, producing smaller quakes on or near the same fault.\n\nMain fault types & the stresses that create them:\n•\tNormal fault (tension/extension): Crust is pulled apart; the hanging wall moves down.\n•\tReverse/thrust fault (compression): Crust is squeezed; the hanging wall moves up (common in subduction zones and mountain belts).\n•\tStrike-slip fault (shear): Blocks slide horizontally past each other (e.g., transform boundaries); motion can be right-lateral or left-lateral.\n\nWhy some places shake more:\nMost large earthquakes occur at plate boundaries where stress accumulates fastest: subduction zones (big thrust quakes), continental collisions (reverse faults), and major transforms (strike-slip).\n\nImage generated separately above: labeled diagram showing a fault plane, the earthquake cycle with hypocenter/epicenter and waves, plus normal/reverse/strike-slip fault insets.",

In optics, a ray is an idealized model of light, obtained by choosing a line that is perpendicular to the wave fronts of the actual light, and that points in the direction of energy flow. Rays are used to model the propagation of light through an optical system by dividing the real light field up into discrete rays that can be computationally propagated through the system by the techniques of ray tracing. All three rays should meet at the same point. The Principal Ray or Chief Ray in an optical system is the meridional ray that starts at the edge of the object and passes through the center of the aperture stop. This ray crosses the optical axis at the locations of the pupils. The Central Ray is perpendicular to infrared radiation.

In geometric optics we treat light as straight-line rays that are perpendicular to wavefronts and that obey the rules of **reflection** (angle in = angle out) and **refraction** (Snell’s law) at boundaries.\n\n**Main types of rays you see in ray diagrams**\n\n1. **Incident ray** – the incoming ray that strikes a surface or boundary.\n2. **Reflected ray** – the ray that bounces off a mirror; its angle to the normal equals the incident angle.\n3. **Refracted (transmitted) ray** – the ray that passes into a new medium and bends according to Snell’s law.\n4. **Principal rays** – standard, easy-to-trace rays used to locate images with thin lenses and spherical mirrors:\n\n* **For thin lenses**\n\n  * **Parallel (P) ray:** parallel to the principal axis; after the lens it passes through the focal point (F) (converging lens) or appears to come from (F) (diverging lens).\n  * **Focal (F) ray:** aimed toward the focal point before the lens; emerges parallel to the axis (roles swap for diverging lenses).\n  * **Central/Chief (O) ray:** passes through the optical center and continues essentially undeviated.\n\n* **For spherical mirrors**\n\n  * **Parallel (P) ray:** parallel to the axis; reflects through (F) (concave) or appears to come from (F) behind the mirror (convex).\n  * **Focal (F) ray:** goes through (F); reflects parallel to the axis.\n  * **Center-of-curvature (C) ray:** goes through the center of curvature; reflects back on itself.\n\nIn diagrams, **solid lines** usually show real rays; **dashed extensions** show virtual rays that appear to originate from a point.\n\n---\n\n# Image\n\nI’ve generated a labeled teaching diagram that shows:\n\n* Principal rays for a **converging lens**, **diverging lens**, **concave mirror**, and **convex mirror** (with objects and images).\n* Small insets for **reflection at a plane mirror** and **refraction at a boundary** with angles labeled.\n\nIf you’d like any changes—different colors, thicker lines, or additional cases (e.g., object between (F) and the lens)—say the word and I’ll regenerate it.\n",

This slows the escape of heat to space and **warms the lower atmosphere and surface** until a balance is reached between incoming sunlight and outgoing infrared.\n\n**Without the natural greenhouse effect,** Earth’s average surface temperature would be about **−18 °C (0 °F)**.\n**With it,** the average is about **+15 °C (59 °F)** — warm enough for **liquid water, stable climates, and the ecosystems and agriculture** life depends on.\n\n> Note: Adding extra greenhouse gases (e.g., rising CO₂ and CH₄) **enhances** the effect, shifting the balance and driving **modern climate change**.\n\n---\n\n**Image:** A labeled infographic illustrating the steps above (Sunlight in, reflection, surface warming, infrared out, greenhouse gases re-emitting heat, and the −18 °C vs +15 °C note).",

Above that, lighter gases become more common (start of the **heterosphere**).\n* **Ionosphere:** Not a separate “layer” by altitude alone; it **overlaps** the mesosphere/thermosphere (\\~60–1,000 km) and is defined by ionization from solar radiation (important for auroras and radio).\n\nIf you’d like, I can add typical Celsius/°F scale values on the temperature curve or include example altitudes for planes, balloons, meteors, the ISS, and GPS satellites.\n",

Most ocean carbon is stored as bicarbonate/carbonate, buffering the atmosphere.\n3. **Biological pump:** Phytoplankton photosynthesize; part of their organic matter and the **CaCO₃ shells** from calcifying organisms sink, carrying carbon to the **deep ocean**. Much is respired at depth (CO₂ stored for decades–centuries) and later **upwells** back to the surface and air.\n\n## 3) Route from plant carbon → **fossil fuels** (slow cycle)\n\nOnly a tiny fraction of plant carbon escapes decomposition and fire:\n\n1. **Rapid burial in anoxic settings:** In swamps, peatlands, deltas, or marine muds, dead plant/algal matter is buried faster than it decays. Low oxygen slows microbes.\n2. **Diagenesis & maturation (heat + pressure + time):**\n\n   * **Terrestrial plants → peat → lignite → coal.**\n   * **Marine algae/zooplankton → organic-rich muds → kerogen → oil & natural gas.**\n3. **Geologic storage:** These hydrocarbons remain trapped in rocks for millions of years unless exposed, uplifted, or extracted.\n\n## 4) Weathering, rocks, and volcanoes (slow geologic loop)\n\n1. **Silicate weathering (atmosphere → rivers → ocean):** CO₂ in rainwater forms weak acid that weathers rocks; dissolved bicarbonate flows to the ocean.\n2. **Carbonate formation:** Marine organisms and chemistry turn bicarbonate into **limestone/dolomite (CaCO₃/MgCO₃)** that gets buried as rock.\n3. **Subduction & degassing:** Tectonics carry carbonates and organic sediments into the mantle; **volcanoes** and metamorphism return CO₂ to the atmosphere.\n\n## 5) Human accelerators\n\n* **Fossil fuel extraction & combustion → atmosphere:** Moves carbon from the slow reservoir (coal/oil/gas) to the fast one as CO₂.\n* **Cement production:** Releases CO₂ when limestone is calcined.\n* **Deforestation & land-use change:** Reduces photosynthetic uptake and releases stored biomass/soil carbon.\n* **Methane leaks & agriculture:** Add CH₄, which later becomes CO₂.\n* **Permafrost thaw/peatland drainage:** Frees long-stored organic carbon as CO₂/CH₄.\n* **Ocean uptake & acidification:** Extra atmospheric CO₂ drives more dissolution, shifting seawater chemistry and affecting calcifiers.\n\n## 6) Direct answers to your two “where does plant carbon go?” questions\n\n* **Into the atmosphere:** through plant/animal **respiration**, **microbial decay** (CO₂/CH₄), **fires**, and **human burning** of biomass or extracted fossil fuels.\n* **Into fossil fuels:** when dead plant (or algal) material is **rapidly buried in oxygen-poor sediments**, then **cooked by heat and pressure** for **geologic timescales**, transforming into **coal (mainly land plants)** or **oil/gas (mainly marine algae/zooplankton)**.\n\nIf you’d like, I can tailor a simpler “student cheat-sheet” version or add typical timescales and example environments for each arrow.\n",

This is the **mucociliary escalator**.\n\n**3) What happens to the trapped stuff.**\n\n* When the mucus reaches the throat, you **swallow** it. Stomach acid and enzymes break down most contaminants.\n* If there’s a lot of irritation, sensors trigger a **cough or sneeze**, which blasts mucus and particles out.\n\n**4) Deep areas without cilia: the alveoli.**\n\n* The tiny air sacs (alveoli) handle gas exchange and **don’t have cilia**.\n* Here, roaming **alveolar macrophages** (patrolling immune cells) **eat** fine particles and microbes.\n* What they collect is carried away via the mucociliary escalator (after they crawl to ciliated regions) or through **lymphatic drainage**.\n\n**5) Size matters (where particles tend to land).**\n\n* **Large** (> ~10 μm): mostly stopped in the **nose/throat**.\n* **Medium** (~2.5–10 μm): settle in the **trachea/bronchi**, cleared by cilia.\n* **Fine** (< ~2.5 μm): can reach the **alveoli**, handled by macrophages.\n* **Gases/ultrafine** may be absorbed or exhaled.\n\n**6) When the system struggles.**\n\n* **Dry air, dehydration, smoking, or pollutants** can thicken or paralyze mucus/cilia.\n* Certain conditions (e.g., **asthma**, **chronic bronchitis**, **cystic fibrosis**, or **primary ciliary dyskinesia**) reduce clearance, so particles linger and infections are more likely.\n\n**Quick recap:** your airways trap particles in mucus, **cilia sweep** that mucus upward, and **cough/sneeze or swallowing** removes it; deep in the lungs, **macrophages** finish the cleanup.\n\nIf you’d like, I can add labels or callouts to the diagram tailored to a specific class level (middle school vs. college).\n",

Light from the **illuminator** is focused through the specimen by the **condenser**. The **objective** forms a **real, inverted intermediate image** inside the tube; the **eyepiece** then magnifies that into the **virtual image** you see.\n\n**Total magnification = (eyepiece power) × (objective power).**\n**Resolution** (smallest detail you can separate) improves with higher **NA** of the objective/condenser and with shorter wavelengths of light.\n\n## What each numbered part does (match to the image)\n\n1. **Eyepiece (ocular)** – Magnifies the intermediate image made by the objective; often 10×. Some models include a **diopter** ring to match focus between your eyes.\n\n2. **Head / Body tube** – Holds the optics at fixed spacing so the objective image forms at the correct plane for the eyepiece.\n\n3. **Revolving nosepiece (turret)** – Clicks different **objective lenses** into the light path quickly.\n\n4. **Objectives (4×, 10×, 40×, 100× oil)** – The primary magnifiers; also the main drivers of **resolution** and **working distance**.\n\n   * **4× (scanning):** wide field, easy to find the specimen.\n   * **10× (low):** more detail, still forgiving.\n   * **40× (high dry):** fine detail; use **fine focus only**.\n   * **100× oil:** highest detail; requires immersion oil to boost NA and resolution.\n\n5. **Stage** – Platform that holds the slide. Often a **mechanical stage** with **X–Y controls** for precise movement.\n\n6. **Slide & stage clips** – Secure the specimen directly over the light path.\n\n7. **Coarse focus knob** – Moves the stage quickly to find focus at low power.\n\n8. **Fine focus knob** – Small, precise motion for sharp focus, especially at 40×/100×.\n\n9. **Condenser** – A lens system that concentrates light onto the specimen; usually raised close to the underside of the slide for brightfield.\n\n10. **Iris diaphragm (substage)** – Adjustable aperture beneath the condenser. **Open** for brightness and resolution; **close** for more contrast (but less resolution). Use together with the condenser height.\n\n11. **Field diaphragm (if present)** – Controls the illuminated field size; helps set Köhler illumination and reduce stray light.\n\n12. **Illuminator / LED** – The light source. Often paired with a **brightness control** on the base.\n\n13. **On/Off & brightness control** – Powers the lamp and sets intensity to a comfortable, non-glary level.\n\n14. **Arm** – Structural support; the safe handle when carrying the scope (other hand under the base).\n\n15. **Base & power connector** – House the lamp and electronics; provides stability.\n\n### What’s happening to the image?\n\n* **Illuminator → condenser → specimen:** Light is focused into a cone that passes through the specimen. Transparent/colored areas transmit or absorb light differently, creating contrast.\n* **Specimen → objective:** The objective produces a **real, inverted** magnified image inside the tube.\n* **Objective image → eyepiece:** The eyepiece acts like a magnifier, creating a **virtual image** your eye focuses on.\n* **Result:** High magnification with limited depth of field; tiny focus adjustments and proper illumination are crucial.\n\nIf you want, I can make a printable one-page “How it works + parts” handout using this same diagram.\n",

Often shows layers and may contain fossils.\n* **Metamorphic** – forms when any rock is **changed by heat and pressure** (without melting). Minerals **recrystallize** and may align into bands (e.g., slate, gneiss).\n\n## Main pathways (follow the arrows)\n\n1. **Magma → Igneous**: cooling & crystallization.\n2. **Igneous → Sediments**: uplift exposes rock; weathering breaks it down; erosion moves it.\n3. **Sediments → Sedimentary rock**: burial + compaction + cementation (lithification).\n4. **Sedimentary → Metamorphic**: deeper burial adds heat & pressure; minerals reorganize.\n5. **Metamorphic → Magma**: if heating goes far enough, the rock **melts**.\n6. **Shortcuts**:\n\n   * Any rock type can **weather & erode** back to **sediments**.\n   * **Igneous → Metamorphic** directly (heat & pressure).\n   * **Sedimentary → Magma** if it melts (usually via subduction).\n   * **Metamorphic → Sedimentary** if uplifted, weathered, and re-lithified.\n\n## What drives the cycle?\n\n* **Plate tectonics**: subduction drags rocks deep (heat, pressure, melting); collisions uplift mountains (exposure & weathering).\n* **Water, ice, wind**: power weathering & erosion at the surface.\n* **Heat from Earth’s interior**: fuels metamorphism and melting.\n\n## Quick ID tips\n\n* **Igneous**: interlocking crystals; sometimes glassy or with gas holes.\n* **Sedimentary**: visible grains or fossils; layered or crumbly cement.\n* **Metamorphic**: stretched/banded minerals; harder, denser versions of earlier rocks.\n\n## Big idea\n\nThe rock cycle isn’t a single loop—it’s a **network of paths**.

    "reference_text": "The diagram shows the structures of the respiratory system. They include the nose, trachea, lungs, and diaphragm. The diaphragm is a large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs. When you inhale, air enters the respiratory system through your nose and ends up in your lungs, where gas exchange with the blood takes place. In the nose, mucus and hairs trap any dust or other particles in the air. The air is also warmed and moistened so it wont harm delicate tissues of the lungs. Next, air passes through the pharynx, a passageway that is shared with the digestive system. From the pharynx, the air passes next through the larynx, or voice box. After the larynx, air moves into the trachea, or wind pipe. This is a long tube that leads down to the lungs in the chest. In the chest, the trachea divides as it enters the lungs to form the right and left bronchi (bronchus, singular). These passages are covered with mucus and tiny hairs called cilia. The mucus traps any remaining particles in the air. The cilia move and sweep the particles and mucus toward the throat so they can be expelled from the body. Air passes from the bronchi into smaller passages called bronchioles. The bronchioles end in clusters of tiny air sacs called alveoli (alveolus, singular). The alveoli in the lungs are where gas exchange between the air and blood takes place. Shown also is the rib (or ribs) the protect the lungs and other vital organs within the chest.",

It’s often divided into:\n\n* **Upper respiratory tract:** nose/nostrils, nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, and pharynx (throat).\n* **Lower respiratory tract:** larynx (voice box), trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and lungs (ending in alveoli).\n* **Supporting structures:** chest wall, **diaphragm**, intercostal muscles, and the **pleura** (the double-layer lining around the lungs).\n\n## The parts, in order\n\n1. **Nostrils (nares) & nasal vestibule** – entry points. Nose hairs and mucus trap dust; blood-rich lining warms and humidifies air.\n   *(If you breathe through your mouth, the first steps below are bypassed.)*\n2. **Nasal cavity & turbinates** – twisty shelves that swirl air to filter, warm, and moisten it; smell receptors live high up.\n3. **Paranasal sinuses** (frontal, maxillary, ethmoid, sphenoid) – air-filled spaces that lighten the skull and condition air; drain into the nasal cavity.\n4. **Pharynx (throat)** – three regions:\n\n   * **Nasopharynx** (behind the nose)\n   * **Oropharynx** (behind the mouth; food + air share this space)\n   * **Laryngopharynx** (leads to the larynx for air or esophagus for food)\n5. **Epiglottis** – a leaf-shaped flap that tilts down when you swallow so food doesn’t enter the airway.\n6. **Larynx (voice box)** – contains vocal cords; the opening between them is the **glottis**.\n7. **Trachea (windpipe)** – rigid tube with C-shaped cartilage rings; lined with cilia that sweep debris upward (the “mucociliary escalator”).\n8. **Carina** – the tracheal split.\n9. **Main bronchi** – right and left primary branches; the **right main bronchus** is shorter, wider, and more vertical (aspired objects lodge here more often).\n10. **Lobar (secondary) bronchi** – one to each lung lobe (3 right, 2 left).\n11. **Segmental (tertiary) bronchi** – supply bronchopulmonary segments.\n12. **Conducting bronchioles → terminal bronchioles** – small airways without cartilage; still just conducting air (no gas exchange yet).\n13. **Respiratory bronchioles → alveolar ducts → alveolar sacs → alveoli** – the **respiratory zone** where oxygen enters blood and carbon dioxide leaves across the ultra-thin alveolar–capillary membrane. Type II cells make **surfactant** to keep alveoli open.\n\n**Around the lungs:**\n\n* **Pleura:** visceral layer on the lung, parietal layer on the chest wall; a thin fluid layer lets lungs glide during breathing.\n* **Diaphragm & intercostals:** main breathing muscles.\n\n## How air travels (step-by-step)\n\n1. **Inhale:** Diaphragm contracts and moves down, ribs lift—chest cavity expands, drawing air in.\n2. **Air path:** Nostrils → nasal cavity (or mouth) → pharynx → past epiglottis → **larynx** → **trachea** → **carina** → **right/left main bronchi** → lobar bronchi → segmental bronchi → bronchioles → terminal bronchioles → **respiratory bronchioles** → **alveolar ducts** → **alveolar sacs** → **alveoli**.\n3. **Gas exchange:** Oxygen diffuses from alveoli to blood; carbon dioxide diffuses from blood to alveoli.\n4. **Exhale:** Diaphragm relaxes and moves up; lungs recoil and air flows out along the same path in reverse.\n\n## Quick memory trick\n\n**“N-N-P-L-T-B-B-b-b-A”** → Nose, Nasal cavity, Pharynx, Larynx, Trachea, Bronchi (main → lobar → segmental), bronchioles (conducting → terminal), **A**lveoli (via respiratory bronchioles & ducts).\n\n---\n\nIf you’d like, I can add labels or callouts tailored to your study needs (e.g., “conducting vs. respiratory zone,” or a zoom-in on the vocal cords).\n",

Food enters the digestive system through the mouth and exits the system through the anus. The esophagus is a long tube that connects the mouth and the stomach. In the stomach, chemicals called enzymes change the food into smaller molecules that the body can use. The pancreas is the part of the digestive system that produces important enzymes and hormones that help break down foods. It is located in the abdominal cavity behind the stomach. In the small intestine, our bodies absorb the nutrients from our food. Finally, the large intestine mixes the solid waste material with water so we can easily eliminate it from our bodies through the anus. Overall, there are 9 main organs in the Digestive system.",

It’s a two-part block:\n\n1. a **gated cross-attention (XATTN)** sublayer, and\n2. a **gated feed-forward (“DENSE”/MLP)** sublayer, each wrapped with pre-LayerNorm and residual connections.\n\n---\n\n## Inputs\n\n* **Text hidden states** (H \\in \\mathbb{R^{T\\times d}}): current LM token embeddings.\n* **Visual latents** (Z \\in \\mathbb{R^{M\\times d_v}}): a fixed set of tokens produced by the Perceiver Resampler from one or more images/video frames.\n* (Learned) **gating projections** that turn each token’s state into an element-wise gate.\n\n---\n\n## Step-by-step flow\n\n### 1) Gated Cross-Attention (XATTN)\n\n* **Pre-norm:** (\\tilde H = \\mathrm{LN}(H)).\n* **Cross-attention:** queries (Q) come from (\\tilde H); keys/values (K,V) come from (Z).\n  [\n  A=\\mathrm{MHA}(\\tilde H W_Q,\\; ZW_K,\\; ZW_V)\n    ]\n* **Gate the visual update:** compute a token-wise, channel-wise gate\n  [\n  g_x=\\sigma(\\tilde H W_{gx}+b_{gx})\\in\\mathbb{R^{T\\times d}},\n    ]\n  then modulate the cross-attn output and add residually: [\n  H^{(1)}=H + g_x \\odot A.\n    ]\n  The gate lets the layer learn **how much** each token should trust vision, often starting near “closed” so initial behavior matches the base LM.\n\n### 2) Gated DENSE (position-wise MLP)\n\n* **Pre-norm:** (\\hat H=\\mathrm{LN}(H^{(1)})).\n* **MLP/Dense:** (F=\\phi(\\hat H W_1 + b_1) W_2 + b_2) (with a standard nonlinearity (\\phi), e.g., GELU).\n* **Gate the MLP update:**\n  [\n  g_d=\\sigma(\\hat H W_{gd}+b_{gd}),\\qquad\n  H_{\\text{out}}=H^{(1)} + g_d \\odot F.\n    ]\n\n---\n\n## Why the gating?\n\n* **Stability with frozen backbones:** The LM (and typically the vision encoder) can remain frozen; new parameters are in the XATTN/DENSE paths and their gates. Gating prevents overwhelming the LM with visual signals early in training and enables smooth **modality balancing**.\n* **Token-specific control:** Gates are computed **per token** and **per channel**, so some words (e.g., nouns near image mentions) can open the visual pathway more than others.\n* **Regularization by design:** With gates near zero, the block reduces to an identity map, which curbs overfitting and preserves strong language priors.\n\n---\n\n## Placement in Flamingo\n\nThese Gated XATTN-DENSE blocks are **interleaved at several points** inside the LM stack. During inference on interleaved image–text streams, each text segment can query the relevant **cached** visual latents via the XATTN, while standard self-attention continues to handle language context.\n\n---\n\n## Summary of components\n\n* **LayerNorm (pre-norm)** before each sublayer\n* **Multi-Head Cross-Attention** (Q from text, K/V from visual latents)\n* **Learned sigmoid gates** (g_x, g_d) (element-wise modulation)\n* **Position-wise MLP (“DENSE”)**\n* **Residual connections** after both sublayers\n\nIf you’d like, I can annotate the diagram with your preferred symbols (e.g., different gate shapes, head counts, or exact tensor sizes) and export it as SVG or PDF.\n",

    "reference_text": "A linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, which store elements contiguously in memory, linked lists store elements in nodes that are scattered throughout memory. The first node is called the head, and it serves as the starting point for the list. The last node is called the tail, and its next pointer is null. The sequence of nodes is established by linking each node to the next node in the sequence using their next pointers. This allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements at any position in the list.",
